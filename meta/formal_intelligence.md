  positive psychological passion (the pursuit∘happyness; having fun in the environmental sun #contagiousmiles) v negative attention seeking (wanting to do better; being a good sport stuck in the proverbial fort #determination) #priming
provide (historic) context, where each cryptic context is its' own language, and perfect memory c̄s at a cost to benefit ratio(n)
by providing "valid" respones = stunted growth, and development
by providing alternative perspective = stunt ed growth (playing chess without knowing it's "chess")
                                                        no board layout, pieces,..
                                                                     ^linear anyway; computers are dimensionless, like speedreading warez, but we like to think of them as one dimensional

(-init = do some"-thing" #peerpressure) v (+init = inactivity is allow(alidat)ed)
should hith be allowed to init? @who? @name, goal(±v∓), ∵reason, (∴response) = msg
^i only had most of this squiggled

so a chess game could be played in multiple ways
[@ intelligencexperiment+ house_points(intelligencexperiment@mm(/n|a/)i)∵ context∴ response]
where context can be
 the last move
 a list of moves; /both|human|computer (will log it's own, and human, responses, but logs are secondary to the primary provided ∵context, which should be historically all inclusive for the /specifi(ed|c)/ context)?/
 board state
 moves + board state, board state + moves, board states, /board states|moves/,..
 …
ttemporal ordering can be arbitrary, but it's better to be consistent, unless you want superintelligence, let alone mahaintelligence #sanskrit
 this allows logged contexts to be compared; not just this /conversation|discussion/ #relativity
 but including responses in the context, like a list of moves in chess, is for suboptimal intelligence; to be included in the process #ipo

[@ intelligencexperiment+ house_points(intelligencexperiment@mm(/n|a/)i)∘ log∵ context∴ response]
 log = responses; the eol is a dependency for +hp
 who needs ∵context? maybe they are=
  a move can be represented by board states

snakes, and ladders, involves multiple personalities
 [@ dice+ श्याम+1∵ [+ (λx∘,x(x))(λx∘1,x(x))]∴ give me a better roll this ttime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
  then we need to use vedic references in our ∴response for confirmation bias; it should include the full pkg (including ttimestamps), unless testing paranormal psychic abilites
  ttime is /meta|contextual/

cp `cat` /material_world/'verse/kṣīra-sāgaraḥ/sūrya/bhūmi/egypt; sync # spiritual_word = / ∘ all formal assumptions
 iff a personality transmits a context∘responses, orn't; i will do likewise as a sign of intelligence, we must fit in to get along x perl #sync
  ^i knew all about this way way well before i even squiggled

 [X] = /joining|combining|composing|../ phrase; package full of data for you to dm
   = delimiter; maybe only oneness like in sanskrit? #some"-thing"ness
 X = delimiter; this could be explicit no"-thing" graphs the point
 [] = parting phrase; no"-thing" else left to say, right? who needs dandas?
msg would beec̄ " [X] meta msg []", where ttime∈meta
 so " [X] [X] ttime sspaciocoordinates [] [X] what is the ttime mr dogg or [] []", where sspacial_coordinates = add(ressable)_places; is specio a word? it is now!!! :D
  maybe " [X] to [X] from msg [] []" v " [X] meta msg []", where meta = " [X] to from []", and to' ttime will be variably empty for docommentation purposes             #superpositio(nal)ness
no data for a long ttime is either one space, or many spaces; it's better to be explicit, and leave spaces for artful padding #cfg
anyone, who evolved handwriting 1ˢᵗ, knows space is ambiguous #no"-thing"ness
/packaging(box(e|ing)s(initialisation|termination)?|wrappings)?/ = \n #pkg #cfg

cobra charming my hand whilst moving it, and my clown head, side-to-side, is like walking past trees in a geo; it looks more 3d, more real(istic) #perception
 games can support more realism ∴ reality can be rewritten to be more real
