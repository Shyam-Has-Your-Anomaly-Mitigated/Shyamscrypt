is math unproductive? (multi)selective macros is optimised counting(skipping; linequations are probably good for (worfian)neuroplastic entanglement, like step counting)

open hardware can be formally verified against docommentation; stress testing, cosmic ray detection,..
 see what makes it tick; graffiti confetti attacks, boombox confetti attacks,..
