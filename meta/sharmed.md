is math unproductive? (multi)selective macros is optimised counting(skipping; linequations are probably good for (worfian)neuroplastic entanglement, like step counting)
/key|r-expression|dcg|../log @macros @dos @self+improvement @nag-ginz @..
c(li)pboard; decentralised security (like vm s(hare; upstream, in a world full of recursive os(hyam))andbox)
 internal crypto, external clear(endering); only the user should know any"-thing" (perfect spyware is assumed; in a world full of backdoors, and propaganda), on top of cryptic tongues (cfg, where c needs to be the sol, f = 4, and little g notation is the performant localised velocity)
  /equational|algorithmic/ crypto #meta(probably why homoiconicity has been propaganda'd as far away from the industry as possible; state managing oops is just the easiest to crack (nobody /hacks|memorises on a ((computerless `(s(andy)os(and,?hi))`)? survival)? beach somewhere #mmmarge'pizza/ their evals anymore), and smalltalk comes from l(isp)i(pl)s(malltalk)p(minikanren) comes from /ipl|Î»calculus/ comes from sanskrit (just like every language) comes from sanskrit)
(sorting,..) algorithms can be optimally boosted; single pass to determine optimal algorithm could save ttime, where savings are comparative #intelligence
sanskrit autonaming; problem solved!!! :D #namespaces #(personalvbusinessvbuisnessvbidnessvbetnessv..)docommentation
optimisation is better thought as collapsing waveforms
