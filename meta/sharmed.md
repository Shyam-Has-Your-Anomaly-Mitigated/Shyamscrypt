is math unproductive? (multi)selective macros is optimised counting(skipping; linequations are probably good for (worfian)neuroplastic entanglement, like step counting)

 internal crypto, external clear(endering); only the user should know any"-thing" (perfect spyware is assumed; in a world full of backdoors, and propaganda), on top of cryptic tongues (cfg, where c needs to be the sol, f = 4, and little g notation is the performant localised velocity)

(sorting,..) algorithms can be optimally boosted; single pass to determine optimal algorithm could save ttime, where savings are comparative #intelligence
 type check the data format, then zero pass, then optimally verify #logix3aching

optimisation is better thought as collapsing waveforms
colour-coded modes,.; psychopriming
