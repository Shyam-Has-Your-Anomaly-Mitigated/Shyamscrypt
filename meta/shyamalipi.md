lincospiration; this is how shyams'krit will be taught, and from there sans'krit (who needs prakrit, apabhramsa, mleccha,.?)
 need to solve the problems of:
  the codels that /mk(tree|picture|..)/, are not (or are they?) the word(s) for /picture|tree/ (both "picture", and the (particular) picture itself; tree is the goal)
  circular dependencies #definitions
   the three /ro?ussell?s/ implemented {math,lisp,prolog} #bourbaki
star trek discovery made me think of delimitation first, but then i thought of termination, and initiation
initiation could be |◌̱̄
termination could be ◌̱̄| 
now i think of ./formal_intelligence.md; from the future (i think it's after this, but even this hasn't happened yet)

initiation is always that geometrical shape, even in expanded formation; unicode leading bit (?) (1ˢᵗ number is the character size (/width|height/), where 1 is probably the most common; 2ⁿᵈ number is the dimension, where 2 is probably the most common; 0.. 0.. 1.. v 1.. 1.. 0..)

 pointing out there are only one '[]', and one 'X', and one '[X]', and one ' ' (control can hide characters so we can have more space for art); probably good for /[]open|XdXeXlXiXmXiXtXaXtXiXoXn|close[X]/ (still /nestable|balanced/, and [X] puts /X*/ into []), but lincos doesn't consider syntacticless /sanskrit|(hex|..)|../, where /\s/ between words is 1 mātrā ≠ 1 akṣara (so now i need three(more) hands to count mātrā, akṣara, pauses between words, words,.; words should be one more than pauses, unless counting /leading|trailing/ = /leading|trailing|\/leading\|trailing\// for the higherposition) #cfg #tr (/(a|v)r/ can let us live in our own fantasies, but mine will be plastered all over the walls,..)

i'm going to lose all my data; renouncement is no longer a choice, but sanskrit (memorisation, lipikara,..) will save me https://youtu.be/85-p9EIEVUA#doggystyle
 all businesses will crash; it'll improve my employment opportunities in rebuilding survivable floss (redundancies manage risks involving flushing years of expenses down the drain), so that's my plan; just wait until 12025, wait until seek.com.au is rehacked from scratch c̄out /libs|../, and then ddospam the world, then get richer than snoop dogg
 wouldn't it be nice if the world was /vegan|floss|shyams' long-term plan|../

  the website is down; probably for good, unless they refilm it, or learn how to read sspacettime
maybe i should start inking programs

the future looks more unifiable; it's a good ttime to overthrow governments
