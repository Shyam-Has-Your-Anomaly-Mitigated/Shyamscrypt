no mods; black mirror blocks, but for physical presence
sspaces
 you apply to enter the room; i'll get to bookings later
 everyone in the room has to agree to let you in
 you can autoconditionally cfg hack them in, based on histats; physical violence, triggers,.. (i'm the exception #godmode)
 application order takes precedence
punctuality is a sign∘intelligence; mental health(based economy)
bookings; you can book as far into the future as you want, but if you `cancel<miss, where earlier<soonervlater`, then you lose mental health points
like chopsticks; ask, before act; look, before leap; make a mistake, and you s/lose/gain/ fewer mental health points; positivity is like evolutionary tiers
 puzzle game example; you have to 100% a tier to climb the ladder, it's not necessarily progressive (a chess intelligence can't win nots, and not-nots; t³), and a "buggy" (socially experimental) intelligence serves as a reminder (and a jackpot; both positive, negative, neutral,..)
  an early tier: you have a button to check solution #training_wheels
  a later tier: the button is removed, and you gain fewer mental health points if you use it again, even for testing software; the same rules apply to every discipline; get it right the first ttime #hill_climbing #mindfield
no blindspots = no cheaters
a potential problem, where popularity measures contribution; good for entertainment, bad for evil troublemakers, probably bad for science,..
ratings, and feedback, are ~
 you get mental health points for doing both; we can dm it, and advance language processing
 should ratings be positive, {positive|negative|neutral}, numbers, percentages,.; how many /positive|negative/ key presses is better than holding duration, and you can do both to match feedback
 sanskrit ratings are worth more points; if you're willing to risk your' karma
 eeg is good feedback, access /counts|duration/ are also good feedback; eeg dm for one hit wonders
 is this needed anymore? how we judge? self-reflection? let people choose how they want to live, and dm evolution from the social experiment, or award points for dm
points reset to zero every day; no possession, no hoarding, no /days off|holidays/,..
fasting gives physical health points, meditating (eeg inception waves) gives mental health points; so yogis can afford a water pipe like jackie chan had in the desert jacket, and also a bong, and ganja,..
 but you have to book it, and be punctual,.; otherwise all your favourites will be overpriced (most of the ttime), unless rng is on your side, but it's a gamble, like /weather|roulette|../ reports
actually sanskrit should be worthless; you only learn iff you want to
references from contributions distribute points; you get more points if you do it properly, but we'll dm what lookup you access, and source trails will be credited
we value newer (more recent) contributions more, but we charge less for them, orn't (bookings,..); economical bubbles
it's more intelligent to be fully booked, but it's a blessing, and a curse
software can auto, and boost health points, but for bugs
maybe you shouldn't access source, until you implement the spec; this'll progress our technological advancement, and you get cheaper resource allocation; this goes for all products, but to make a chair out of wood; you need to prove your knowledge of carpentry for the safety standards
you just learn hacking, and hack bots to mkbots, then hack those bots to "implement the spec"; this is the optimal safety standard, along c̄ virtual labs,..
we have to do the math to decide whether paper is physically /better|healthier|sustainable/ than digital,.. (mental health, physical health, environmental health,.; /processing|plant cycles|../ v /energy costs|thermal dmg|../)
comparison is a good rating system, and can be circularly complex (not theory, but practicæl); you can compare apples to apples, oranges to mozart, pencils to porn,.. (specificity v generality)
digging ≥10k deep holes in the ground for holy dm(scheduling,booking,auctioning,..), size-mic,.; multiscan(surface, 3d extraction, life detection,..), vacwm,..
 how many gs? it should be variable, but we want to preserve life, death,..
 where to put it? what's it made of? now it's ≥11k, but towering above tidal level
 this was after thinking about transplanting forked roots to remove smaller roots wrapped around it, or transplanting the smaller roots, iff it's more survivable
 lasers are optimal indoor lighting
  there's plenty of sspace at the bottom in ttime at the speed∘light
   optical tweezers to optical tweezers to..
    they can mfg, and self-destruct to hide themselves, mv around inside; it's like holowave projection, but holoparticle projection instead
     giant me nudie "running my homeworld" in my birthday suit on my birthday every birthday, "levitation" (brasupport,..), strip super models c̄ my xray vision, walk through walls, "disarm" enemies,..
 ride the solar flare like a wave; surf's up!!! :D
  where is my lava volcanoe macro drone disx? dot them around the globe, and launch from the otherside, or maybe perpendicularity c̄ angular momentum, or maybe a head on collision, and fold sspacettime, or..
comprehensiveducation; reimplement linguistics, mathematics, mathing, computing, hacking, emacs, unix,.. #diy
 p(rolog)(n)g tests
 how do you mathematically express the second half? 1-½=½ #shyama(ma)th
afterlife xp: start c̄ rng linguistics, including body language (octopussy of all demos); vision is probably harder to adapt to, but for mirrors, dizzy filming, zoomoving>3d,..
