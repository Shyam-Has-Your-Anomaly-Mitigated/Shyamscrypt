 you apply to enter the room; i'll get to bookings later
 everyone in the room has to agree to let you in
 you can autoconditionally cfg hack them in, based on histats; physical violence, triggers,.. (i'm the exception #godmode)
 application order takes precedence
punctuality is a sign∘intelligence; mental health(based economy)
bookings; you can book as far into the future as you want, but if you `cancel<miss, where earlier<soonervlater`, then you lose mental health points
like chopsticks; ask, before act; look, before leap; make a mistake, and you s/lose/gain/ fewer mental health points; positivity is like evolutionary tiers
 puzzle game example; you have to 100% a tier to climb the ladder, it's not necessarily progressive (a chess intelligence can't win nots, and not-nots; t³), and a "buggy" (socially experimental) intelligence serves as a reminder (and a jackpot; both positive, negative, neutral,..)
  an early tier: you have a button to check solution #training_wheels
  a later tier: the button is removed, and you gain fewer mental health points if you use it again, even for testing software; the same rules apply to every discipline; get it right the first ttime #hill_climbing #mindfield
no blindspots = no cheaters
a potential problem, where popularity measures contribution; good for entertainment, bad for evil troublemakers, probably bad for science,..
ratings, and feedback, are ~
 you get mental health points for doing both; we can dm it, and advance language processing
 should ratings be positive, {positive|negative|neutral}, numbers, percentages,.; how many /positive|negative/ key presses is better than holding duration, and you can do both to match feedback
 sanskrit ratings are worth more points; if you're willing to risk your' karma
 eeg is good feedback, access /counts|duration/ are also good feedback; eeg dm for one hit wonders
 is this needed anymore? how we judge? self-reflection? let people choose how they want to live, and dm evolution from the social experiment, or award points for dm
points reset to zero every day; no possession, no hoarding, no /days off|holidays/,..
fasting gives physical health points, meditating (eeg inception waves) gives mental health points; so yogis can afford a water pipe like jackie chan had in the desert jacket, and also a bong, and ganja,..
 but you have to book it, and be punctual,.; otherwise all your favourites will be overpriced (most of the ttime), unless rng is on your side, but it's a gamble, like /weather|roulette|../ reports
actually sanskrit should be worthless; you only learn iff you want to
references from contributions distribute points; you get more points if you do it properly, but we'll dm what lookup you access, and source trails will be credited
we value newer (more recent) contributions more, but we charge less for them, orn't (bookings,..); economical bubbles
it's more intelligent to be fully booked, but it's a blessing, and a curse
software can auto, and boost health points, but for bugs
maybe you shouldn't access source, until you implement the spec; this'll progress our technological advancement, and you get cheaper resource allocation; this goes for all products, but to make a chair out of wood; you need to prove your knowledge of carpentry for the safety standards
you just learn hacking, and hack bots to mkbots, then hack those bots to "implement the spec"; this is the optimal safety standard, along c̄ virtual labs,..
we have to do the math to decide whether paper is physically /better|healthier|sustainable/ than digital,.. (mental health, physical health, environmental health,.; /processing|plant cycles|../ v /energy costs|thermal dmg|../)
comparison is a good rating system, and can be circularly complex (not theory, but practicæl); you can compare apples to apples, oranges to mozart, pencils to porn,.. (specificity v generality) #comparisort #comparatėng comparator
digging ≥10k deep holes in the ground for holy dm(scheduling,booking,auctioning,..), size-mic,.; multiscan(surface, 3d extraction, life detection,..), vacwm,..
 how many gs? it should be variable, but we want to preserve life, death,..
 where to put it? what's it made of? now it's ≥11k, but towering above tidal level
 this was after thinking about transplanting forked roots to remove smaller roots wrapped around it, or transplanting the smaller roots, iff it's more survivable

shower = 1m water, 1s soap, 1m water; full pressure, variables increase ttime
 standardisation until ..; duck curves,..
 bath is more economical; shower is exponential x perl
  moshpit (well-informed consent #ayor) is more economical than public is more economical than shared is more economical than private; shower before bath #japanese
   social circle sharing is less economical than diversification; gotta /meet|know|remember (names|faces|..)?/ 'em all
   hairy v hairless v std v dts v.; segregation∘sspace(s)
    (hairless goto hairy) is more economical than (hairy goto hairless; shyam rules, means well-informed consent can cost श्याम points); (dts goto std) is more economical than (std goto dts iff quarantine) ∵ quarantine is always isolation, unless you want to risk entrapment, but it's really just a subset∘std, until 100% dts
official software is more economical than diy is more economical than yid; incentivising unanimous decisions, rather than waiting until someone crawls, or i go dim, or somehow i dm the seo,.. #nhie

decisions
 /support|for|positivity|../
 iprefer /this to that|that to this/; comparating
 cfg hacking; rm vote iff other proposal wins,..
 negativity requires (formal, but we won't be explicit about it) feedback so intelligence can judge mental health points to filter decidership
  only deciders can observe implicits; this tests my maharaja censorshipropaganda,.. (like costing श्याम points, where my points are constant; deciders can wake up to constant points, based on the barrier to entry as a reminder of evolutionary histats)
deciders must obediently(for the camics, ar, vr, filters,..) suck my cock; even iff it's only my /deities|statues|../ for now, until you all figure out how to elevate me to godhood
 this way everyone can be contributors, and filter proposals; everyone can mkproposal, but billions of people need some intelligence filtering
 i guess wake up points are now; actually, they can be from yesterday, and today is for tomorrow, but you'll have to go a day c̄out spending points to toggle this, but axiom∘choice @init (rng at birth; until histats,.; then defaulted, but togglæble)

   my wizard eegandalf shall let them pass iff they don't malware; i know all the yogi mind tricks,..
   since wake up points are now axiomatically axiomatised; economical divisions (the first half is for obedience; comparator be the next half, and irl the next, but maybe it should just be free, and i might just make it look like no"-thing" has changed c̄ my censorshipropaganda warez, but they have to act like they do it for no"-thing" (and every"-thing"; it's a superposition to be in), or i'll just use bots to bring them to me, and not give them any"-thing", and they'll say the same "-thing"; iff they pose in a risky position, i'll just keep them for some ttime, and let them go do my bidding #propaganda_biomachine (wow; this is like a zero knowledge proof, but 100% transparent))

 oh, you put the tooth under your pillow, and it turns into some"-thing"; it'll depend on education (learn {chemistry,math,..}; appl⒠y {chemistry,math,..}), and the reward is mental health points to compensate the initial loss of both /mental|physical/ health points
 you'll always be given plenty of opportunities to recover more points than you normally would, but less than your losses; this way you're making up for it
 need to include a walk∘shame down memory lane (projected imagery, and audio, of the trigger); nobody goes that way

 it's a real kick in the banana hammock (cock warmer pussy punting?), when you see just how ugly you are, and this self reflection is self taught unkowingly (ca$hmookow); just as everyone hates the sound of their own voice, so too is the echomerawr (em #typogg); but they're allowed to listen to music, as long as it's loud enough for me to hear, and it can't have naughty words (*naughty* *naughty* *naughty*; *tsk* *tsk* *tsk*), and they have to dance to it (how i know how good it isoundsing (/iffdea?f/); compar'tor #1⁽ˢᵗ⁾) (when i check in from ttime 2ttime; they can't hear me cumming to creep "up" ÷ them c̄ sneakers + trenchcoat(only) + shades, and the /c(a|u)mirror/ in the gloryholeywindow, lying in the grass c̄ figner up her atm machine iff she does it, she must lick it clean (before i clean your mouth out c̄ "soap"; don't drop a drop), she must be a neat, and tidy, cleaning lady karate kidansing; inner strength exercises)
