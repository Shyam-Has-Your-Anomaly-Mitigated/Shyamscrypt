[ ] need to find the symbolic purity, and put it here‚Ä¶

my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ‚àµ ttime is relative
analogous flags are /a?symmetrically/ double sided so my flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï

/double|multi|poly/ entendre = superposition = paradox

‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ hack; I just self-realised my name backwards ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, and I want to marry her for /it|ever/
I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? lazy list(s)! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective; concurrency required
^my future self will perform cpr (continuum preservation reservation; continuum preserved)
reality can be rewritten as flappy bird; Pyro (TF2) singing what a wonderful world
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls, and fairy floss (atomic floaters), to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too
adware; mytldr, Lucy in the Sky cÃÑ (scarlett) Diamonds
unlock 100% of your brain by eeg, ga√±jƒÅ (hufflepuff, but I am slytherin; dicks, pussies, and ass.pdf holes), nootropics, and other psychedelics
anal stimulation is a new experience that deeply reinforces previously unbridged gaps between brain cells for learning; take the dirt road when the river runs red
Hasyayoga, other emotions, tastes (sugar), smells, sights, sounds, pain (bed of nails),.; the body is the rootsystem of our brainplants
there are no blind spots ‚à¥ there's more to nerves, or there are more nerves
acting lessons are a broadspectrum cure for mental health; playttime ass.pdf
animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking
I hand delivered a calf, and observed him stand, and walk, in the first hour
dogs understand human language
parrots speak human language
apes use sign language
we are apes
planet of the apes is real
t pose is the gesture for "get hugged"

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)
magic eye, and other illusions, including dreams, are hallucinogenic; 100% brain
viruses,.. might be nanobots

the physical manifestation of the computer that simulates our holowave projection on the surface of this planet as the surface of /an? (photon|electromagnetic)/ interface; computational galaxies, solar systems, /(inter)?planetary/ rings, asteroid fields, planet surfaces, life, molecules, atoms,..
the physical manifestation of our destruction is an extinction event involving debris from part of the computer computing it; rings, fields, /(meteor|planet|solar|blackhole|galactic)/ orbits, supernovas, supercharged particles,..
the physical manifestation of the afterlife is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word
death is limbo waiting to be (warped|folded) to the (past|present|future|other (dimension|directional vector))
if you brick yourself; your (local)? ttime (temporal waveform) will collapse in on itself, and new time will expand so the dimensions of the (room|space|ttime) willn't change
it's easier to ttime travel when you only consider ttime as the only physical factor of physics; (been)? doing it since observed
ttimed sensory shunting

I have defeated arseholes; "our souls" from their perspective
3 ≥·µà = (2|3); (\\|\/)
-                                 t,                                                           (t|w?hole)
all triangles are equilateral, but our observationally perspective perceptIon is as altered but as our observationally sensory visIon; both observationally (illusive|illusory) illusIon
by extension all rectangles are squares; all shapes are equalateral by triangulating two consecutive sides, in any dimension
G√∂delling
measuring illusion v reality; superpositionally
didn't I write some"-thing" yet; re (v|a)r phantom limb experiment? I might need to goto a different ttime, and do this‚Ä¶
where in ttime am I now?
this is how to experience temporal entanglement for yourself cÃÑ yourself
I am one in many of myself; (discrete|incontinuous) ttime v (indiscrete|cpr;cp) ttime
we are all just doing graffiti for each other
that's better; see? I saved myself, like I said I would; as I rip off my shirt
‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó = 3t = ttime travel
is physics the (material|illusion) v (spiritual|reality) (in a matrix pill)? superpositionally both is the right answer to the right question; what is right angle?
right (commentreasure)?
