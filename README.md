  - the dprk just bought the plans for nukes from the russians off of the tor network with their bank heists; their leader grabbed donald trump by the pussy in front of everyone, and made him travel all the way there just to be grabbed by the pussy, and he makes a pussy cÃÑ his mouth too (it's his homoiconic trademark of homoiconicity)
  - either china is technologically superior, and declares cyberwarfare, or they are technologically inferior liars
  - either governments are organised crime syndicates (tax = extortion,..) where judges implicitly sentence rape (human rights issues on an internationally global scale) in an n·µó ∞ world of technological superiority, or governments are idiocracies where doctor zaius (zeus?) isn't held accountable
  - overthrowing is illegal, but the loophole is a communication network (avoiding middle men) of half the population to force the government to accept specific leadership, and then forcibly gut the government, and hold the exgovernment workers accountable by reintroducing corporal punishment, torture,.. #job_security_is_a_lie #if_someone_claims_who_they_voted_for_they_could_have_a_run_in_or_have_been_framed_or_be_patriotic_or.. #zkp=they_won,where_i_voted

  - alcohol kills brain cells; the wine industry wants customers to believe their products improve "longevity" (aka neurodegenerativity), but genetics is the primary factor (natural selection v selective breeding)

 - transparency in government; they've wanted it since before i was even born? yes, minister!
 - if the australian government uses their ass access bill to force me into a backdoor, and issue a gag order, then i simply won't publish, so if i ever stop then you already know why, and i've preemptively superpositioned the gag order (loophole); they don't really want to promote stem anymore, because "\"i'm sorry dave, i can't do that\": ethics in software development" is the reason i'm unemployed, because i don't sign ndas (well, i'll sign it; assuming you read my personal docommentation, so i can counter for negligence of due diligence, since plausible deniability is deniable as charged), but i'm working on a plan to get a deadend job to escape from this dystopian country; since my degree was a waste of ttime, and just an excuse for the government to put me in debt to support the jobs of others, because that's how economics works; take a little here, put a little there, shuffle it all around; right? yes, minister! #ponzi #egyptology
 - antistem propaganda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkMvm_rsTvI
 - the leader of a nation bullshits their way in (what wall? /and|so/ they did pay for it after all!), setting the example as the rolemodel for all government workers are bullshitters, and they are corporately funded, so when we hold exgovernment workers accountable; the richest people will be included aswell aswell
 - business people who mention small claims; they make way more money than they pay you + small claims = lawyers give better legal advice, and /juicy|drinkie/ businesses are ripe for the taking, like a perl
 - there's a fine line between black mail, and white mail; ‚Üí(longcut v legal action) = blackmail, legal action = whitemail = saved lives = rightmail (o ring accountability) #if-then-else
 - there's a fine line between selfish offence, and selfless defence; exit clause (in silence), de-escalation, aikido,..
 - the only legal legal advice that is legal is consult /law enforcement|floss lawyers|proprietary lawyers|judges/; /hierarchical|n·µó ∞/ opinions (like gods, magicians, shrinks, doctors, surgeons, butchers,.; are you a walking encyclop√¶dia of any"-thing" besides the vedas? some just don't know any better, /lazy|carry|innumerately primed? committee/, tunnel vision, corruption, severance package /grads|upskill|re-employment ops|dole bludgers|professional beggars/,..)
 - human right = /nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare|selective mutism/; it's better not to say a word to law enforcement (they get paid, and want you to do their work for them, because they're lazy), and save it for the judge; just chant the "miranda" mantra (in whatever dialect) #word
 - judges always screw somebody over, it's their job; oneside loses, while the otherside wins
 - judicial discretion, at every lvl; at least they're open about their bribery practices ($5-0 is $5-0, but it depends on the judge)
 - judges worship the roman pantheon, so it's best to speak their sacred tongues; "si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses", "nemo tenetur prodere seipsum", "accusare nemo se debet nisi coram Deo", "nemo tenetur armare adversarium contra se", "nemo tenetur edere instrumenta contra se", "nemo tenere prodere se ipsum", "nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare",.. #words #words‚àòwisdom

I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation (there is only shyam space)
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? /repl|lazy list(s)/! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective; concurrency required

reality can be rewritten as flappy bird; Pyro (TF2) singing what a wonderful world
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls (chocolate, and salty), and fairy floss (atomic floaters), to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too (the physical manifestation of intellectual limitation); you can't know more than you can, so you can't know what you could know if you had more braincells ‚àµ to know about some"-thing", you need to be able to know some"-thing" so you can connect to it like a server of information in a repository

animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking
I hand delivered a calf, and observed him stand, and walk, in the first hour
dogs understand human language
parrots speak human language
apes use human sign language
we are apes, who can only speak human (sign) language; other species will have to communicate on our behalf, but we are all aliens (this is outerspace)

t pose is the gesture for "get hugged"

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)

the physical manifestation of /the afterlife|apparent death|p(hilosophical)?zombie(sz)/ is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word
death is /limbo|purg(e|atory)/ waiting to be (warped|folded) to the (past|present|future|other (dimension|directional vector))
if you brick yourself; your (local)? ttime (temporal waveform) will collapse in on itself, and new time will expand so the dimensions of the (room|space|ttime) willn't change
it's easier to ttime travel when you only consider ttime as the only physical factor of physics; (been)? doing it since observed
