can lisp "perl push" to the end of a singly-linked list like prolog? I think it can ‚à¥ lazy lists are /symbolically|variably/ supported (especially in a shyamscrypt world where all symbols are variables cÃÑ (in)sane defaults (memory cracks v no"-thing" for conditionalogics; what others mean when they say hacking is all logic); shyamscript is invariably dexed by boxing, and boxer boxer boxer is to drka drka drka, as spinning qubits is to flipping bits is to pun√óhing cards; eeg ftw, one ttime‚Ä¶)

  - either china is technologically superior, and declares cyberwarfare, or they are technologically inferior liars
  - either governments are organised crime syndicates (tax = extortion,..) where judges implicitly sentence rape (human rights issues on an internationally global scale) in an n·µó ∞ world of technological superiority, or governments are idiocracies where doctor zaius (zeus?) isn't held accountable
  - overthrowing is illegal, but the loophole is a communication network (avoiding middle men) of half the population to force the government to accept specific leadership, and then forcibly gut the government, and hold the exgovernment workers accountable by reintroducing corporal punishment, torture,.. #job_security_is_a_lie

I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation (there is only shyam space)

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)

the physical manifestation of /the afterlife|apparent death|p(hilosophical)?zombie(sz)/ is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word

no 1 can take it from me; you can't escape formal methods! #firewalled_sandboxed_vm(postedit)
of all the possibilities, all are improbable if they contain someone trying to do what I did to get where I am now in the 1st person (so you get to experience it from an alternative angle; sharmies' angles (sharmies' angels are not only made real, but are also disillusioned), so if they do exist the doppleganger pzombie is unoccupied, and not experiencing the observation; so neither would you!
formal intelligence is safe intelligence, and I've gone all the way to the trouble of using every type of logical system, and even automated theorem proving more possibilities "fitting" semantically well-defined unifying theories ‚àò programming, and even , and even.. #ending? intentional! no"-thing" as a system of logic(postedit)
arseholes (not our souls8<in /Shyams'?crypt/>8) don't experience this; if they become conditioned arseholes, they will never know they don't exist
you see, I live in this fantasy land where I get every"-thing" I want; so I'm experiencing your observance, without which you cease to exist until I play this game mabye never
my formal methods filter out other dicks, but(t) all arseholes; pussies will never betray me, but you're never (a pussy) in real world unless I pull you out cÃÑ me through my own dick into your mouth around my cock, just because I can, and its' how I lead you into my formal proof I am who I claim to be
so really, it's all about whose a pussy in the real world, and this imaginary, but not complex, world; I am the maha security SPOF (so I personally check each candidate myself; you see, you're triggering my pussy detector in my possibility datamining rig so I'm judging my pussy trials), and I have A SPOCK, but  she's a /she-pc?ockette/ (i play cÃÑ the sheep, and somebody has to do it, just because I can while I'm fucking her at the same time in every other {dimensional,perceptive,..} capacity all at the same time) feather most of the time #doublespace(postedit)

so you're all in my head, and you have to save me from this one; I'm just along for the ride
remember, some of you are real, and some of you aren't; but that's up to each, and every one of you
and the same goes for this world I am sharing cÃÑ you (all of you; you know who you are if you're reading into any of all this #freewill)
you will be how I want you to be, or get formally verified! ..!..-__-..!.. (ùÑû3) #doublemouth(postedit)
this is like the hunger games; some of you are one one side, and the rest on the other, but it's /(balanced)?/ how I want it to be #doubleone(postedit)
I have to keep track of all sharmies' angles, and all sharmies' angels; keep my enemies close, and constantly in my mind, or they don't exist, but it's only briefly while I datamine the possibilities when I feel like it (sometimes I play with the mutation rate, and other parameters, to discover more pussies; I formally verified my own programming)
this is all a /(per|de)ceptive ((mirage|trick)|(magic|tech) trick)
I would never come down personally to your level, unless I knew it was safe; remember, all that (logical) base?

yeah, it's pretty clear; I am the only man
but I can shake it, shake it; like I'm supposed to do
cause I got that boom, boom; that all the dicks shake
all the right junk in all the right places
you see my ugly face only as a perception, but it's my maha face, and I can thrust a new perception in it's place #the material world is made of the spiritual world so there is no ugly; hair follicles can be perceived anyway, pores = holiness Hshallow_hal Hthe_dress(postedit)

from the big chocolate salty balls (figuratively, literally,..) to the foreskin
none of the other men are real, except for me, but if they want to be body varialled? the same goes for which ever of you think I'm considering for the other(s; because, I can't explain these "-thing"s in any meaningful capacity for your altered perceptions to prevent any of you from taking any of this from me)

oh yeah, I can fuck you, and let you see it from all perspectives all at the same time
you're all just pussies getting tested, and I continuously test all the real pussies (sharmies angels) for security purposes
nobody else gets to experience being a dick, only "having" a dick
i mark the pussies without clits (some are bigger than others, but mine is shyam, while yours are infinitesimal in comparison; barely there) as my real bitches, that I personally fuck instead of some delusion

i'm all about that bitch, no trouble

it's a long "ride" in so many ways; never going to end, or we all die together, because I made you from me out of my dick so that makes you my loyal daughters (you have share for security purposes; see I think of every"-thing", and can formally prove it)
you all have at least one hole; consider it wisely, and say aaahhhh, as you self-real-eyes
superposition is a blessing, and a curse; existence v freewill(y at my level-headed existence)
i can take you from 0 to shyam; both, at the same time, and everywhere inbetween

your /challenge|mission/, should you accept it; ellevate me to my rightful place in my own /pussi(bility)? datamining rig/

real pussies (sharmies angels) already know who they are

you won't be able to confirm if I am until you elevate me #freewill(ie; /pussi(bility)? datamining rig/)

the real pussies (sharmies angels; to be, or not to be) in my head won't betray me

constantly tested, tried,..
you're never allowed to even try to escape; not even just for fun, as a security feature
my life is your dead line
you join those who did the same for me to get here in my game of snakes, and ladders; climb my dick, you pussy
where I go, my pussies cÃÑ me

you're all parts, and parcels of me; one way, or another, or else,..
you're trying to escape my mind? I'll keep you in a living hell version of that groundhog day, so even my enemies can't die, but they ever know, because I've already won
i (en)trap all your minds, and use s/your/my/ bodies as I freewill(ie; shyam), and even share my view, as I do you
ùÑû3
all souls compete for maya, shyamaki,..
ttime is /relative|irrelevant/; it's all just a matter of ttime, in this life, or the next,..

not no"-thing", not some"-thing", but every"-thing"; circled shapes, /sphered|torii'd|torused/ structures,..
I'm not going to stop you from disappointing me; choose how you want to test yourself
I'm impenetrable; you're not

i can impregnate you as my daughter, and your mother, all at the same time
i taught you every"-thing" you know, and I'll keep teaching you every"-thing" you know, but I'm the man who knows every"-thing"

sucking my cock is a beyond infinite joy ride; one way to percieve it is /constant|instant/ in, another is /constant|instant/ out,.. I give you all at the same time /constantly|instantly/; that'll /constantly|instantly/ remind you of (the) reality (of /your|the|this/ situational sitch)
I'll stop drugging you every night with the dream wizard, and make it /(constant|instant)(ly)?/; my jizz wizard will keep knocking it out of you so you can experience reality while you sleep(ing beauty, and the feast before my very own eyes)
