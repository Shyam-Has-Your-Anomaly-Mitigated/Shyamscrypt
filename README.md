counting memory top-down is portable; subtraction until no"-thing", and you've run out of memory, unless you're a rapper, but it still raps to no"-thing"; (- 0 1) is the max scalability, but not (- 0 +1), assuming (- x y) = x-y, and not (- x y) = (cons -x -y)
can lisp "perl push" to the end of a singly-linked list like prolog? I think it can ‚à¥ lazy lists are /symbolically|variably/ supported (especially in a shyamscrypt world where all symbols are variables cÃÑ (in)sane defaults (memory cracks v no"-thing" for conditionalogics; what others mean when they say hacking is all logic); shyamscript is invariably dexed by boxing, and boxer boxer boxer is to drka drka drka, as spinning qubits is to flipping bits is to pun√óhing cards; eeg ftw, one ttime‚Ä¶)
 clocksin.mellish have a different idea of what "difference list" means than lpn! (I'll confirm when I reread lpn! I just confirmed it by looking it up @ ch7.2, but I plan to reread lpn!)

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_list
 as long as it isn't an empty list; holes can be pun√óhed into any dex of a list, and lazily evaluated (call by need)
 [Ttime_log, Repll_Evaluating_Perpetual_Lazy_Lists, Shyam] % now this is easy from any perspective!!! :D (perhaps even easier from the difference list perspective, rather than a funtional lazy eval strat perspective of metacircular interpreters, but they are still good for ttime hacking)

my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ‚àµ ttime is relative
analogous flags are /a?symmetrically/ double sided so my flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï
¬±000 = ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ

/double|multi|poly/ entendre = superposition = paradox

‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ hack; I just self-realised my name backwards ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, and I want to marry her for /it|ever/; how do I typeset /shyama?ki/? (jaya! like ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§ï‡•Ä has a /twin|consecutive/ bro)
I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation (there is only shyam space)
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? /repl|lazy list(s)/! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective; concurrency required
^my future self will perform cpr (continuum preservation reservation; continuum preserved)
reality can be rewritten as flappy bird; Pyro (TF2) singing what a wonderful world
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls, and fairy floss (atomic floaters), to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too (the physical manifestation of intellectual limitation); you can't know more than you can, so you can't know what you could know if you had more braincells ‚àµ to know about some"-thing", you need to be able to know some"-thing" so you can connect to it like a server of information in a repository
adware; mytldr, Lucy in the Sky cÃÑ (scarlett) Diamonds, ne0 (pig latin) mattresses (it's my trick)
unlock 100% of your brain by eeg, ga√±jƒÅ (hufflepuff, but I am slytherin; dicks, pussies, and ass.pdf holes) (the best way is eeg so you can datamine when it wears off; eating 100% is the healthiest to save lungs, but some smoking (nasal exhale into sinuses) is healthy for respiratory disease, like the pandemic, but too much of a good "-thing" is not always a good "-thing", like ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ multiplied by an exclusive(ly) negative /(h?in(t|(du)?))/ 1<), nootropics, and other psychedelics
anal stimulation is a new experience that deeply reinforces previously unbridged gaps between brain cells for learning; take the dirt road when the river runs red
Hasyayoga, other emotions, tastes (sugar), smells, sights, sounds, pain (bed of nails),.; the body is the rootsystem of our brainplants
there are no blind spots ‚à¥ there's more to nerves, or there are more nerves
acting lessons are a broadspectrum cure for mental health; playttime ass.pdf
animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking
I hand delivered a calf, and observed him stand, and walk, in the first hour
dogs understand human language
parrots speak human language
apes use sign language
we are apes
planet of the apes is real
t pose is the gesture for "get hugged"

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)
magic eye, and other illusions, including dreams, are hallucinogenic; 100% brain
viruses,.. might be nanobots

the physical manifestation of the computer that simulates our holowave projection on the surface of this planet as the surface of /an? (photon|electromagnetic)/ interface; computational galaxies, solar systems, /(inter)?planetary/ rings, asteroid fields, planet surfaces, life, molecules, atoms,..
the physical manifestation of our destruction is an extinction event involving debris from part of the computer computing it; rings, fields, /(meteor|planet|solar|blackhole|galactic)/ orbits, supernovas, supercharged particles,..
the physical manifestation of /the afterlife|apparent death/ is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word
death is /limbo|purg(e|atory)/ waiting to be (warped|folded) to the (past|present|future|other (dimension|directional vector))
if you brick yourself; your (local)? ttime (temporal waveform) will collapse in on itself, and new time will expand so the dimensions of the (room|space|ttime) willn't change
it's easier to ttime travel when you only consider ttime as the only physical factor of physics; (been)? doing it since observed
ttimed sensory shunting

I have defeated arseholes; "our souls" from their perspective

all triangles are equilateral, but our observationally perspective perceptIon is as altered but as our observationally sensory visIon; both observationally (illusive|illusory) illusIon
by extension all rectangles are squares; all shapes are equalateral by triangulating two consecutive sides, in any dimension (lines in the 2‚Åø·µà; points in the 1À¢·µó, where the measurements are 0)
all lengths are equal, so the distance between any two points for ttime travel; coincidence? https://wayforward.archive.org/#I_searched_prolog_then_btc_to_aud (I was like when did I do this? I must've been so high! I must've done it in the past of my future‚Ä¶)
G√∂delling
measuring illusion v reality; superpositionally
didn't I write some"-thing" yet; re (v|a)r phantom limb experiment? I might need to goto a different ttime, and do this‚Ä¶
where in ttime am I now?
this is how to experience temporal entanglement for yourself cÃÑ yourself
I am one in many of myself; (discrete|incontinuous) ttime v (indiscrete|cpr;cp) ttime
we are all just doing graffiti for each other
that's better; see? I saved myself, like I said I would; as I rip off my shirt
‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó = 3t = ttime travel
is physics the (material|illusion) v (spiritual|reality) (in a matrix pill)? superpositionally both is the right answer to the right question; what is right angle?
right (comm(en|i)treasure)?
I am fucking all, the girls, since that's everybody else cast under my (magic|sufficiently advanced TechNoLogic) spellusion
I reject everybody elses'/ s/reality/illusion/, /and substitute my own; ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ-10 (just to be safe) virgin wives in a total population measurement of ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, where 3‚â§‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, so there's always one of me cÃÑ more frames

the possibilities are endlessly ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, but the formal probabilities are formally limited to one at a ttime; my formal observances are ttimeless
all possibilities are only probabilities if it is my possibility; one possibility to (shyam) rule(s) them all
