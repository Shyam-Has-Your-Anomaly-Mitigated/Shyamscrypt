[ ] need to find the symbolic purity, and put it here…

my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ स्वस्तिक, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ∵ ttime is relative
analogous flags are /a?symmetrically/ double sided so my flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ स्वस्तिक

/double|multi|poly/ entendre = superposition = paradox

I discovered the most elegant way to read, and rewrite, space+time c̄ योग; I golfed it
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along c̄ every"-thing" else) is more understandable c̄out academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; not all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation
