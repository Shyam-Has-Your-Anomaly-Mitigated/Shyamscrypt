[ ] need to find the symbolic purity, and put it here…

my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ स्वस्तिक, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ∵ ttime is relative
analogous flags are /a?symmetrically/ double sided so my flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ स्वस्तिक

/double|multi|poly/ entendre = superposition = paradox

माया hack
I discovered the most elegant way to read, and rewrite, space+time c̄ योग; I golfed it
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along c̄ every"-thing" else) is more understandable c̄out academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; not all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? lazy list(s)! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective
^my future self will perform cpr (continuum preservation reservation; continuum preserved)
reality can be rewritten as flappy bird
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls, and fairy floss, to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too
adware
unlock 100% of your brain by eeg, gañjā, nootropics, and other psychedelics
anal stimulation is a new experience that deeply reinforces previously unbridged gaps between brain cells for learning; take the dirt road when the river runs red
Hasyayoga, other emotions, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, pain (bed of nails),.; the body is the rootsystem of our brainplants
there are no blind spots ∴ there's more to nerves, or there are more nerves
acting lessons are a broadspectrum cure for mental health; playttime ass.pdf
animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking
I hand delivered a calf, and observed him stand, and walk, in the first hour
dogs understand human language
parrots speak human language
apes use sign language
we are apes
planet of the apes is real
t pose is the gesture for "get hugged"

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions
magic eye, and other illusions, including dreams, are hallucinogenic; 100% brain
