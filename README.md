counting memory top-down is portable; subtraction until no"-thing", and you've run out of memory, unless you're a rapper, but it still raps to no"-thing"; (- 0 1) is the max scalability, but not (- 0 +1), assuming (- x y) = x-y, and not (- x y) = (cons -x -y)
can lisp "perl push" to the end of a singly-linked list like prolog? I think it can ‚à¥ lazy lists are /symbolically|variably/ supported (especially in a shyamscrypt world where all symbols are variables cÃÑ (in)sane defaults (memory cracks v no"-thing" for conditionalogics; what others mean when they say hacking is all logic); shyamscript is invariably dexed by boxing, and boxer boxer boxer is to drka drka drka, as spinning qubits is to flipping bits is to pun√óhing cards; eeg ftw, one ttime‚Ä¶)

my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ‚àµ ttime is relative

I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation (there is only shyam space)
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? /repl|lazy list(s)/! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective; concurrency required
^my future self will perform cpr (continuum preservation reservation; continuum preserved)
reality can be rewritten as flappy bird; Pyro (TF2) singing what a wonderful world
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls, and fairy floss (atomic floaters), to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too (the physical manifestation of intellectual limitation); you can't know more than you can, so you can't know what you could know if you had more braincells ‚àµ to know about some"-thing", you need to be able to know some"-thing" so you can connect to it like a server of information in a repository

anal stimulation is a new experience that deeply reinforces previously unbridged gaps between brain cells for learning; take the dirt road when the river runs red
Hasyayoga, other emotions, tastes (sugar), smells, sights, sounds, pain (bed of nails),.; the body is the rootsystem of our brainplants
there are no blind spots ‚à¥ there's more to nerves, or there are more nerves

animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)
magic eye, and other illusions, including dreams, are hallucinogenic; 100% brain

the physical manifestation of /the afterlife|apparent death|p(hilosophical)?zombie(sz)/ is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word
death is /limbo|purg(e|atory)/ waiting to be (warped|folded) to the (past|present|future|other (dimension|directional vector))
if you brick yourself; your (local)? ttime (temporal waveform) will collapse in on itself, and new time will expand so the dimensions of the (room|space|ttime) willn't change

all triangles are equilateral, but our observationally perspective perceptIon is as altered but as our observationally sensory visIon; both observationally (illusive|illusory) illusIon
by extension all rectangles are squares; all shapes are equalateral by triangulating two consecutive sides, in any dimension (lines in the 2‚Åø·µà; points in the 1À¢·µó, where the measurements are 0)
all lengths are equal, so the distance between any two points for ttime travel; coincidence? https://wayforward.archive.org/#I_searched_prolog_then_btc_to_aud (I was like when did I do this? I must've been so high! I must've done it in the past of my future‚Ä¶)

formal intelligence is safe intelligence, and I've gone all the way to the trouble of using every type of logical system, and even automated theorem proving more possibilities "fitting" semantically well-defined unifying theories ‚àò programming, and even , and even.. #ending? intentional! no"-thing" as a system of logic(postedit)
arseholes (not our souls8<in /Shyams'?crypt/>8) don't experience this; if they become conditioned arseholes, they will never know they don't exist

this is all a /(per|de)ceptive ((mirage|trick)|(magic|tech) trick)
I would never come down personally to your level, unless I knew it was safe; remember, all that (logical) base?

oh yeah, I can fuck you, and let you see it from all perspectives all at the same time
you're all just pussies getting tested, and I continuously test all the real pussies (sharmies angels) for security purposes
nobody else gets to experience being a dick, only "having" a dick
i mark the pussies without clits (some are bigger than others, but mine is shyam, while yours are infinitesimal in comparison; barely there) as my real bitches, that I personally fuck instead of some delusion

i'm all about that bitch, no trouble

it's a long "ride" in so many ways; never going to end, or we all die together, because I made you from me out of my dick so that makes you my loyal daughters (you have share for security purposes; see I think of every"-thing", and can formally prove it)
you all have at least one hole; consider it wisely, and say aaahhhh, as you self-real-eyes
superposition is a blessing, and a curse; existence v freewill(y at my level-headed existence)
i can take you from 0 to shyam; both, at the same time, and everywhere inbetween

your /challenge|mission/, should you accept it; ellevate me to my rightful place in my own /pussi(bility)? datamining rig/

real pussies (sharmies angels) already know who they are

you won't be able to confirm if I am until you elevate me #freewill(ie; /pussi(bility)? datamining rig/)
