my digital flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï, but that's randomness for you so you couldn't even tell when I implemented this feature ‚àµ ttime is relative
analogous flags are /a?symmetrically/ double sided so my flag is now in a state of superposition between /forward|reverse/ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï

/double|multi|poly/ entendre = superposition = paradox

‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ hack; I just self-realised my name backwards ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, and I want to marry her for /it|ever/; how do I typeset /shyama?ki/? (jaya! like ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§ï‡•Ä has a /twin|consecutive/ bro)
I discovered the most elegant ways to read, and rewrite, space+time cÃÑ ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó; I golfed them
quantum eraser rewrites space+time unreliably, and is considered a dangerous experiment unless you know what you are doing; we are self-observing so we influence the past, present, and future, from each perspective proven by temporal entanglement
there is only ttime; from now on I will only refer to ttime, because physics (along cÃÑ every"-thing" else) is more understandable cÃÑout academic obfuscation
there is no ttime; /(a|no)t/ all possibilities are probabilities, and ttime is proof of observation
^that's a superposition by intelligent design; superposition is proof of freewill
[, ttime log? lazy list(s)! shyam] 8< this can also be done from Shyamscrypt (Prolog), but I think it's easier from a Shyamscript (Lisp) perspective; concurrency required
^my future self will perform cpr (continuum preservation reservation; continuum preserved)
reality can be rewritten as flappy bird; Pyro (TF2) singing what a wonderful world
the reason there is no mass is an illusion; reality could be any"-thing" from cotton balls, and fairy floss (atomic floaters), to the unimaginable
you need more braincells to expand intellectual capacity, but they're an illusion too; you can't know more than you can, so you can't know what you could know if you had more braincells ‚àµ to know about some"-thing", you need to be able to know some"-thing" so you can connect to it like a server of information in a repository
adware; mytldr, Lucy in the Sky cÃÑ (scarlett) Diamonds
unlock 100% of your brain by eeg, ga√±jƒÅ (hufflepuff, but I am slytherin; dicks, pussies, and ass.pdf holes) (the best way is eeg so you can datamine when it wears off; eating is the healthiest to save lungs, but some smoking (nasal exhale into sinuses) is healthy for respiratory disease, like the pandemic, but too much of a good "-thing" is not always a good "-thing", like ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ multiplied by an exclusive(ly) negative /(h?in(t|(du)?))/ 1<), nootropics, and other psychedelics
anal stimulation is a new experience that deeply reinforces previously unbridged gaps between brain cells for learning; take the dirt road when the river runs red
Hasyayoga, other emotions, tastes (sugar), smells, sights, sounds, pain (bed of nails),.; the body is the rootsystem of our brainplants
there are no blind spots ‚à¥ there's more to nerves, or there are more nerves
acting lessons are a broadspectrum cure for mental health; playttime ass.pdf
animals are more intelligent than previously thought, and I have theories of how they communicate, and how to communicate to human babies for augmented learning, and intelligence amplification; besides neurofeedback hacking
I hand delivered a calf, and observed him stand, and walk, in the first hour
dogs understand human language
parrots speak human language
apes use sign language
we are apes

t pose is the gesture for "get hugged"

reality has multiple perspectives; one of my favourites is as /an? (unified|entangled)/ list of instructions (in any language (math,animal,..), in any way; fractally) (perception,..)
magic eye, and other illusions, including dreams, are hallucinogenic; 100% brain
viruses,.. might be nanobots

the physical manifestation of the computer that simulates our holowave projection on the surface of this planet as the surface of /an? (photon|electromagnetic)/ interface; computational galaxies, solar systems, /(inter)?planetary/ rings, asteroid fields, planet surfaces, life, molecules, atoms,..
the physical manifestation of our destruction is an extinction event involving debris from part of the computer computing it; rings, fields, /(meteor|planet|solar|blackhole|galactic)/ orbits, supernovas, supercharged particles,..
the physical manifestation of /the afterlife|apparent death/ is our ability to /warp|fold/ ttime; /(staying)? true to my word
death is limbo waiting to be (warped|folded) to the (past|present|future|other (dimension|directional vector))
if you brick yourself; your (local)? ttime (temporal waveform) will collapse in on itself, and new time will expand so the dimensions of the (room|space|ttime) willn't change
it's easier to ttime travel when you only consider ttime as the only physical factor of physics; (been)? doing it since observed
ttimed sensory shunting

I have defeated arseholes; "our souls" from their perspective

all triangles are equilateral, but our observationally perspective perceptIon is as altered but as our observationally sensory visIon; both observationally (illusive|illusory) illusIon
by extension all rectangles are squares; all shapes are equalateral by triangulating two consecutive sides, in any dimension (lines in the 2‚Åø·µà; points in the 1À¢·µó, where the measurements are 0)
all lengths are equal, so the distance between any two points for ttime travel; coincidence? https://wayforward.archive.org/#I_searched_prolog_then_btc_to_aud (I was like when did I do this? I must've been so high! I must've done it in the past of my future‚Ä¶)
G√∂delling
measuring illusion v reality; superpositionally
didn't I write some"-thing" yet; re (v|a)r phantom limb experiment? I might need to goto a different ttime, and do this‚Ä¶
where in ttime am I now?
this is how to experience temporal entanglement for yourself cÃÑ yourself
I am one in many of myself; (discrete|incontinuous) ttime v (indiscrete|cpr;cp) ttime
we are all just doing graffiti for each other
that's better; see? I saved myself, like I said I would; as I rip off my shirt
‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó = 3t = ttime travel
is physics the (material|illusion) v (spiritual|reality) (in a matrix pill)? superpositionally both is the right answer to the right question; what is right angle?
right (comm(en|i)treasure)?
I am fucking all, the girls, since that's everybody else cast under my (magic|sufficiently advanced TechNoLogic) spellusion
I reject everybody elses'/ s/reality/illusion/, /and substitute my own; ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ-10 (just to be safe) virgin wives in a total population measurement of ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, where 3‚â§‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, so there's always one of me cÃÑ more frames
arseholes aren't real; I let you measure your own superpositional existence
