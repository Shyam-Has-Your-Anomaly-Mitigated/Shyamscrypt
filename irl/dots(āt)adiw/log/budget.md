$3.49 + habanero meal; prescribed once every ≥4h, 1killergg optiMaxiMally DELICIOUS
 <1g fat (100%) $0.34 10.5g ($3.40 105g) massel(100% vegan brand wins the vegan race)' vegetable stock cubes; maybe i'll try chicken soup c̄ rice (i just soak the (rice)³ on warm for a few hours (immediately after eating), and /it's ready to go meal|insert rice before cooking/; then optionally garnish c̄ habanero, and cook)
 <1g fat (50%) $1.50 250g coles' microwave basmati rice
 <1g fat (20%) $1.35 75ml ($2.70 150ml) lee c̄ kee' (premium) soyasauce; i stopped cooking it in, and it's healthier than /cheese|olives/
                              ^ i just discovered ctrl+&; only at github
 <$1.00 1 habanero (bring back the carolina reapers; where the wild "-thing"s are) v <$7.00 <283g pataks' vindaloo paste (especially c̄ massel' chicken stock cubes) v <$2.80 <250ml master foods' hot chilli sauce (and friends, but i only ever tried each one once, and cam't remember; is sweet chilli sauce vegan yet?)
 seed∘rapey-rapey tastes good c̄ rice; butttits ~96.7% fat ass fuck #cheesey,not_corney‽
 seed∘ganja∘shiva tastes good c̄ rice; the brand that's so curdey af #seedey,not_huskey‽

i think i need an l∘soyamilk for $1.60 for calciumetal (who needs wheat soup? the sugar probably isn't healthy), an orange a day for <$1.00 for /vitamania ?c/ (i just want mangoes!),.; maybe i should just order the vegvit, and grow ganja grow like a lightbulb
other (bean|nut|fruit|vegetable|bamboo|mineral|elemental|quantum|duality|..) milks; /coco(bean|nut)?/ milk + /coco|(edible)? chocolate (like milk powder, but't i've triedn't yet)?/ = hot chocolate ∈ m∘t
(bubble; is this /vegan|caffenated|../?) tea (hemp(er(r))ed)ganja #decarb(the legal industry doesn't know about this loophole)
/vegan cheesie|chillie/(these might not exist yet) p(otatoe)ringles(s) are good for mexicanoes, (chilli + whatever; s3 branded) hummus; snv are dipless chips, and right now i have cravings for more, and the shop opens in half an arn, and it takes half an arn to get there, and i'll eat the first first, and save the seconds for my pet 'gator in the deep bowels of my sto(r)mache #/ma?xæy/
hopefully my right hand doesn't fester; i /don't have|didn't buy/ any"-thing" for it, nor do i totally recall /whe(re|n)/ this occurrance∘blood transpired, and all i can do is wash it in tap water i wouldn't drink from; even the sink i do drink from is only marginally better, but i stopped suffering symptoms for the most part (more s/troubleshooting/debugging/ pending further investigation ∘the facts; no matter∘import)
it probably happened whence i dropped 1snvno"-thing" else, as this was my maha distraction on my way in through the midoor; i need to reboot ff so i can see this confounded button (should've done it before this commit; typing one-handed sux, especially c̄ my right hand, but my left is contaminated c̄ floor pringles n i'll dispose of these chopstix)
