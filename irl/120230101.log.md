 yoga: 2sūryanamaskāra(u) (goal = -slow -fast -slow (padmāsana × prāṇāyāma × half /opened|closed/ eyes) +slow +fast +slow; looks like it needs to be done twice, on(c)e for each side; slow will be mantras + englishes just to make it slower, fast will follow the prāṇāyāma, and all the permutations (eventually; for now just read it left2right, until kbs consultation); miday can do both east, and west, in that order, before, and after, in the most ofious way obvcourse)
 sūryanamaskāra:
  zhàn zhuāng (standing meditation) + añjali mudrā (origami hands) + "Oṃ Mitrāya Namaḥ । Om, greetings to the one who is affectionate to all. (exhaled; maybe exhale every (pre)word) Oṃ Hrāṁ । (heart chakra; 𝄞3ʳᵈ eye @ lhs chest)"

 i'm determined enough to get the latest os to datamine the cheapest one, across every brick & mortar i cbf walking to @12023
  or iff android one, and wikipedia, figure themselves out; it'll save me ttime
   maybe i'll just wait until my side-splitting telephone stops working; i think it's android one, nokia g10, or some"-thing"; maybe the warranty is still good, but i cbf trying to find the receipt (they should just s/print/etch/ it on the fucking back; look at all that prime real estate!)
    i need to be able to zoom for sanskrit; i've resorted to /(solar|memory)-based/ navigation, i even bought pocket notebooks (one is for notes, one is for gambling, one is for sūryanamaskāra, and a s/couple/pair/ of virgins), i hate web browsers that don't export (fuck google warez; i hate emails too, but maybe there's a convenient way to; nope, they probably do it on purpose to artificially bloat our accounts, or force us to delete every"-thing", and fuck off to a better service; self-hosted is optimal, but ⅓ party due diligence is the most legal),..

12022.12.29.02: wateration, `mv bladder`
and i was planning to buy one on friday; officeworks doesn't open on the /last|first/ day of the year, and i don't even know where harvey norman is, nor how far it is to walk for an extra $11; i was as close to buying the bing lee; this is no coincidence; i only get double paid on thursday enough to buy it anyway, and that was the same for the bing lee, but their page for it was buggy anyway, and officeworks is impossible to datamine, and they probably don't stock it, and their lazy employees don't even want to even check
maybe it'll get cheaper after the new year… (the warranty will last longer; maybe i'll just buy a $50 telephone, until i ever look this up again #cbf(after missing the bing lee for the same reasons; $837 is more than i've ever spent on a telephone in my life, probably altogether))
12022.12.29.01: wateration
$837 in my spreadsheet, harvey normans $848 is ~
google just raised the price of their pixel 7, literally s/overnight/over an hour, or so; since i last refreshed officeworks, and saw this reflection across the internet; sourced from google online/; krishnas' arrangement for me not to buy one
