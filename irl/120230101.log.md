they pay to keep vegan off the labels
they used to dm their surveillance; over two decades ago (the only ttime i ever got caught shop lifting, and i wasn't shop lifting, but they were looking bu$y; performing illegal searches)
they can't dm their surveillance to improve their quality of service; they prefer to pump & dump, instead of catching shop lifters (i stole so much product one time; it was at least $40, and i got away c̄ it),..
the animal industry pays to put their products on our shelves; maybe tempting cold turkeys, maybe tempting cravings, maybe tricking like cheerleader fx (i don't fall for either),.. (this begins to stand out too much, when it's all i ever see; it makes more sense for customers to replace their animals, than to take the bait (i always see it; therefore, nobody is removing it; therefore it doesn't work that way))

 grasshopper koongfa in a picturesque grand of steps up the grand stepcase of a grand of words down word…
  step one is a philosophical history course of self reflection; the first rule of grasshopper koongfa is there is no grasshopper koongfa; so you must meditate on it, and share all your steps for peer-review during show & tell (after /sh?ifa|sai ha/ approval; iff you haven't tried, and truly, proven it for yourself, then don't try it at all, and let me know instead, so i can ask around about it first; eye rubbing, groin attacks, zui quan, jackie /cham?ing/ down "-thing"s, terminal velocity flight training, (o'ringed,..) astronaught training, catching arrows after learning how to breath like tarzan, bullet /stopping|bending/, fire meditation, grenade holding, nuking, /space|solar/ walking, /supernova?ing/,.; we won't train you unless you have a brain that works, and you'll train yourself anyway)
   who are you? u+07?..
   what is your name? u+07?..
   …
  step two is (literal) grass hopping (literals)
  step three is as far as i got; grass hoping, while watching (the) grass grow (until i hop to the fourth step, and beyond; some say it doesn't exist, and i bellyeve(d) them)
  step four is eating grass; with any /luck|stick(en bone)s/, you should be famished
  step five is a s/grasshopper/locust/ swarm; or is it the other way around? either way, we need at least a couple of grasshoppers to take the next step
  step six is grasshopper from scratch (dot org); 2<3
  step seven is taking a chance to /stab|jab|.*ab/ our middle fingers at abuudmot(acronym but we do not notify our target); gambling (bet on a better acronym that sounds like personhood, but really isn't)
  step eight is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step nine is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step ten is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step eleven is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step twelve is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step thirteen is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step fourteen is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step fifteen is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step sixteen is consuming "grass" recipe(s); just "grass" (the righteous way of justice), leche c̄ "grass" (the face your fears way of milking), onion ∧ banana "grass" (the chakra way of guru pathik), of "grass" (the (/of|../) kind of way of course), hopper "grass" (the grasshopping way of (the) grasshopper(s)),..

and i was planning to buy one on friday; officeworks doesn't open on the /last|first/ day of the year, and i don't even know where harvey norman is, nor how far it is to walk for an extra $11; i was as close to buying the bing lee; this is no coincidence; i only get double paid on thursday enough to buy it anyway, and that was the same for the bing lee, but their page for it was buggy anyway, and officeworks is impossible to datamine, and they probably don't stock it, and their lazy employees don't even want to even check
maybe it'll get cheaper after the new year… (the warranty will last longer; maybe i'll just buy a $50 telephone, until i ever look this up again #cbf(after missing the bing lee for the same reasons; $837 is more than i've ever spent on a telephone in my life, probably altogether))
12022.12.29.01: wateration
$837 in my spreadsheet, harvey normans $848 is ~
