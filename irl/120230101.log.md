   maybe i'll just wait until my side-splitting telephone stops working; i think it's android one, nokia g10, or some"-thing"; maybe the warranty is still good, but i cbf trying to find the receipt (they should just s/print/etch/ it on the fucking back; look at all that prime real estate!)
    i need to be able to zoom for sanskrit; i've resorted to /(solar|memory)-based/ navigation, i even bought pocket notebooks (one is for notes, one is for gambling, one is for s≈´ryanamaskƒÅra, and a s/couple/pair/ of virgins), i hate web browsers that don't export (fuck google warez; i hate emails too, but maybe there's a convenient way to; nope, they probably do it on purpose to artificially bloat our accounts, or force us to delete every"-thing", and fuck off to a better service; self-hosted is optimal, but ‚Öì party due diligence is the most legal),..
 side-splitting telephones; motorola moto g_ (probably within the (1,4) interval), nokia nokia g10
  push button telephones are more robust, and reliable; i've never had a flip telephone before (to protect, and serve; 2-in-1s are bad though, my laptop stops working iff i close it now)
 i see one adware, and i'm out; who the fuck is responsible for multiple adware payouts? either the app ignores some, or google ignores some, or both; it's bad enough their games are shallow as fuck, that they overcompensate for adware blockers, firewalls (i don't think these work properly),..

 grasshopper koongfa in a picturesque grand of steps up the grand stepcase of a grand of words down word‚Ä¶
  step one is a philosophical history course of self reflection; the first rule of grasshopper koongfa is there is no grasshopper koongfa; so you must meditate on it, and share all your steps for peer-review during show & tell (after /sh?ifa|sai ha/ approval; iff you haven't tried, and truly, proven it for yourself, then don't try it at all, and let me know instead, so i can ask around about it first; eye rubbing, groin attacks, zui quan, jackie /cham?ing/ down "-thing"s, terminal velocity flight training, (o'ringed,..) astronaught training, catching arrows after learning how to breath like tarzan, bullet /stopping|bending/, fire meditation, grenade holding, nuking, /space|solar/ walking, /supernova?ing/,.; we won't train you unless you have a brain that works, and you'll train yourself anyway)
  step two is (literal) grass hopping (literals)
  step three is as far as i got; grass hoping, while watching (the) grass grow (until i hop to the fourth step, and beyond; some say it doesn't exist, and i bellyeve(d) them)
  step four is eating grass; with any luck, you should be famished
  step five is a s/grasshopper/locust/ swarm; or is it the other way around? either way, we need at least a couple of grasshoppers to take the next step
  step six is grasshopper from scratch (dot org); 2<3
  step seven is taking a chance to /stab|jab|.*ab/ our middle fingers at abuudmot(acronym but we do not notify our target); gambling (bet on a better acronym that sounds like personhood, but really isn't)
  step eight is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step nine is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step ten is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step eleven is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step twelve is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step thirteen is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step fourteen is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step fifteen is stealing your (piece‚àò(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned
  step sixteen is consuming "grass" recipe(s); just "grass" (the righteous way of justice), leche cÃÑ "grass" (the face your fears way of milking), onion ‚àß banana "grass" (the chakra way of guru pathik), of "grass" (the (/of|../) kind of way of course), hopper "grass" (the grasshopping way of (the) grasshopper(s)),..

maybe it'll get cheaper after the new year‚Ä¶ (the warranty will last longer; maybe i'll just buy a $50 telephone, until i ever look this up again #cbf(after missing the bing lee for the same reasons; $837 is more than i've ever spent on a telephone in my life, probably altogether))
