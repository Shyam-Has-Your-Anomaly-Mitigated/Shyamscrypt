 yoga: 2sūryanamaskāra(u) (goal = -slow -fast -slow (padmāsana × prāṇāyāma × half /opened|closed/ eyes) +slow +fast +slow; looks like it needs to be done twice, on(c)e for each side; slow will be mantras + englishes just to make it slower, fast will follow the prāṇāyāma, and all the permutations (eventually; for now just read it left2right, until kbs consultation); miday can do both east, and west, in that order, before, and after, in the most ofious way obvcourse)
 sūryanamaskāra:
  zhàn zhuāng (standing meditation) + añjali mudrā (origami hands) + "Oṃ Mitrāya Namaḥ । Om, greetings to the one who is affectionate to all. (exhaled; maybe exhale every (pre)word) Oṃ Hrāṁ । (heart chakra; 𝄞3ʳᵈ eye @ lhs chest)"
