they pay to keep vegan off the labels
they used to dm their surveillance; over two decades ago (the only ttime i ever got caught shop lifting, and i wasn't shop lifting, but they were looking bu$y; performing illegal searches)
they can't dm their surveillance to improve their quality of service; they prefer to pump & dump, instead of catching shop lifters (i stole so much product one time; it was at least $40, and i got away c̄ it),..
the animal industry pays to put their products on our shelves; maybe tempting cold turkeys, maybe tempting cravings, maybe tricking like cheerleader fx (i don't fall for either),..

 grasshopper koongfa in a picturesque grand of steps up the grand stepcase of a grand of words down word…
  step one is a philosophical history course of self reflection; the first rule of grasshopper koongfa is there is no grasshopper koongfa; so you must meditate on it, and share all your steps for peer-review during show & tell (after /sh?ifa|sai ha/ approval; iff you haven't tried, and truly, proven it for yourself, then don't try it at all, and let me know instead, so i can ask around about it first; eye rubbing, groin attacks, zui quan, jackie /cham?ing/ down "-thing"s, terminal velocity flight training, (o'ringed,..) astronaught training, catching arrows after learning how to breath like tarzan, bullet /stopping|bending/, fire meditation, grenade holding, nuking, /space|solar/ walking, /supernova?ing/,.; we won't train you unless you have a brain that works, and you'll train yourself anyway)
   who are you? u+07?..
   what is your name? u+07?..
   …
  step two is (literal) grass hopping (literals)
  step three is as far as i got; grass hoping, while watching (the) grass grow (until i hop to the fourth step, and beyond; some say it doesn't exist, and i bellyeve(d) them)
  step four is eating grass; with any /luck|stick(en bone)s/, you should be famished
  step five is a s/grasshopper/locust/ swarm; or is it the other way around? either way, we need at least a couple of grasshoppers to take the next step
  step six is grasshopper from scratch (dot org); 2<3
  step seven is taking a chance to /stab|jab|.*ab/ our middle fingers at abuudmot(acronym but we do not notify our target); gambling (bet on a better acronym that sounds like personhood, but really isn't)
  step eight is stealing your (piece∘(8)) black belt; it's more impressive iff you stay imprisoned

maybe it'll get cheaper after the new year… (the warranty will last longer; maybe i'll just buy a $50 telephone, until i ever look this up again #cbf(after missing the bing lee for the same reasons; $837 is more than i've ever spent on a telephone in my life, probably altogether))
