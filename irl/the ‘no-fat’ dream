  93.4; wow, that was half a k! so an l, c, 'n' u v i? #1 #blockhead
  i won 157.24% roi @scratchies #tax_evasion_strat@ato #unreported_income@centrelink (begging has (beyond) infinite roi)
   one of each for $145; leading research suggests consecutive losses are probably more probabilistically probable, and the gamblers' fallacy suggests only reinvesting in losses recurses into a negative feedback loop of depression c̄ suicidal tendencies
   /y?i/ ching s/on/divided by/ the day using my precious, and check on rice; bet on the queens' decapitated head, bushy tail between legs to impersonate the queen #rumourlette
    in keeping c̄ the royal society of putting "-thing"s on top of other "-thing"s ∵ "-thing"(s) ÷ other "-thing"(s) = the inverse∘other
   interpreting temporaleaves? learn from /mistakes|losses/, but also jaya!
   …
   i got the heads! #milliways (paradox avoided)
   it only counts if it's flipped bye my hand, and caught bye my hand; the right hand is better than the wrong hand #titw #hindulorian
