i'm a religious zealot

torvalds, aka gordon ramsay, aka ozzy (ozzy ozzy oi oi oi) osbourne, shouldn't need to /proprie-tar-ise|(miss)? 'propriate/ his freedom of speech; everybody else should stop giving him reasons to "offend" by offending #fucking_iff_fucking_you_fucking_can't_fucking_stand_fucking_the_fucking_heat_fucking,_fucking_get_fucking_out_fucking_of_fucking_the_fucking_kitchen_fucking_hells_fucking_bells_fucking_ringing_fucking_in_fucking_my_fucking_ears_fucking
we all know you deliberately make yourselves look like fuck ups by padding,.; erlang wasn't homoiconic for job security, the intelligence winter was /(hacker|jedi)s/ not mktmachine for evil /motherfuckers|buisness people|phb/,.. #plecks_world

raymond; ehmke isn't known as a hacker, only as a bureaucratic bitch (sworn enemy of the status quo; selfie paradox, narcissistic troll,..)
hacking culture; when non-hackers try to get hacking (in)jokes, this is like forced /(over)acting|laughter/ in dnd, or memes that get out of hand from chinese whispers (when picture + picture-based caption, becomes text + text-based picture, becomes (unrelated) picture + (unrelated) text, becomes idiocracy,..),..
just because you do a "-thing", doesn't mean you have become (one c̄) a "-thing"; some people (most) just don't "get it", and are just so /unnatural|inorganic/ about "it"? yes minister!

stallman; minsky wasn't the only one involved, mit wasn't the only one involved,..
i remember stokke… https://youtu.be/CI58RXtAHIQ?t=23m45s …it was the night /before|at/ the end of the day of https://youtu.be/mCXvBhYEYdQ …i thought it was funny at the time (i remember she showed, and told, a photograph of her visit to stallman; probably during query(ing), and satisfaction), but little did i know the feminist conspiracy theory was going to get completely, and totally (inappropriate(ly)), out of hand
governments don't define pedophilia; nature does (i definitely got hard in primary school; those were tough times) (iff you live long enough, a year younger is illegal; iff you live even longer, over (half) a century younger can be legal (longevity perks, along c̄ ordering the government around @pension, (c̄) ordering the queen around @letter, ordering kids around @lawn, ordering professionals around @tax,.; i'm older than all of you, and your societal respect is so fleeting, and short lived, before i toss you in the blender (c̄ spanner into the /work(er|ing)s/ of it) that represents the physical manifestation of the home for infinite losers, unless your seniority is pussyness pursuit of your purest pussification for my superiority))
the only problem is /well-informed|educated/ consent; not all adults are mature, not all children are immature
education should teach loopholes, psychology, and acting lessons; parenting, how to take advantage of other people, and defence against the progressively--at-your-own-pace--catching-up-to-hindu arts (usually involves killing; physically)
education should teach family, local, major /prescriptives|dictatives/ (fallacy of the masses), and at least one minor /descriptive|elective/ (freewill); religions (sins), cultures (taboos), /judicial|jurisdictional/ systems (crimes(yndicates; social experiments)),..
sex education; optional (choose your own adventure; std, sins, taboos, laws,..) practical should be like sports, and other group activities #/fifo (they (both|all involved) have to act accordingly to the formal contractual agreement, and not make each other feel uncomfortable, besides safe words, gestures, eeg,.; or never ever again #surgery #game∘bones)|proprietary|dictatorial|prescribed/
 these days they're really big on choose your own adventure; gender "identity", sexuality, race, species, personality, cosmetics, profession, genetics, religion,..
in my /country|species|planet|solar system/ there is problem

little girls should quit bitching, and do some"-thing" big #size_matters
keep calm, and carry on bitching, iff you don't want to change your life (since that's probably what you always do, and no"-thign" /has|will/ ever change because of /it|you|object(ification)?/); it's good to talk (as iff you're talking to a shrink, orn't; and vice versa, like talking to a shrink as iff you'ren't), so others can correct you, or lead you /ash?tray|gardenpath/
if you want to follow in someones' footsteps; you must get into the mindset of that personality, and try to be(come) that personality, but not mine (obviously; /p(ff|enis envy)/)
what kind of person does it take to be me? me, myself, and i
what kind of person does it take to be you? (future) you you
