The only reason I stopped at $50 last time, was because I lost it in 15m; I started considering it as a form of entertainment, but now one of my strats is to throw $1 at the last number on the board, and keep hitting that same number until it hits; I think it's about $1 per minutes worth of entertainment value, and I've won big doing that, but I was placing $5 per spin, because that's the minimum outside bets, and I wasn't thinking, until it was too late, but it paid off, until I started more than one number at a time.

I'm thinking about alternatives; iff you have any ideas? After my back (hopefully) heals, and my life finally returns to some degree of normalcy; I'm thinking about martial arts. What do you think of these?

Isolation Styles:
‣ Boxing (punching)
‣ Taekwondo (kicking; they go exclusively kamikaze style during competitions, where it's a quest for one-hit-knock-out head-kicking dominance, but sometimes it's a tie fighter; in star wars you can hear screams in space)
‣ Judo (takedowns; subset of Japanese Jujutsu)
‣ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (post-takedown submissions; subset of Japanese Jujutsu; I have some experience)
‣ Muay Thai (clinch; since this is all I'm interested in, I'm less interested to do this one anytime soon)

Compound Styles:
‣ Aikido (the most legal style; protect attacker from harm, while self-defending)
‣ Wing Chun (simultaneously attack, and block, or multiple attack, or multiple block; it's all short-ranged straight movements for speed, not just multi-tasking)
‣ Capoeira (I have some experience from DVDs, but no DVD player anymore; it's got the optimal strategic philosophy, especially flanking to the enemies blindside; it's long-ranged, flanking, dodging, and the circle is good for learning how to read people, but I've never done it, since I don't know anybody else who does it)
‣ Zuì Quán (drunken boxing is good for balance, and co-ordination; it's like Shaolin Buddhist conditioning, but more specifically falling; think Jackie Chan throwing himself on his back in the movie, but his other movie when he fell about 5 several stories from the clock tower onto his head is the most crazy stunt I ever saw, and he did it so many times in the credits until he got it just right, the way he wanted it to be in the movie, but I've seen others fly across the building from a storey, or two, and slam into the wall, and then into the ground; I haven't found anyone teaching this, but I found some videos, and other resources, but it's hardcore)
‣ Internal Strenth, or Inner Strengh, or Spirit(ual), or Conditioning, or whatever; Tai Chi, Wushu, Qigong, Yoga,..

Amritananda called me a green belt at Gōjū-Ryū Karate, the last time I stayed at the farm; I somehow skipped all the colours in-between white, and green.

At Mount View High, I remember they said in the news a girl got shot by an arrow, and used special breathing techniques, I've probably only ever seen in Gōjū-Ryū Karate (they only talked about it, but nobody ever gave an example, but I can imagine what I saw was what it was), to survive.


Wing Chun also has Chi Sau, which is like the circle in Capoeira, and also wooden dummies, which is like Shaolin conditioning; especially for the forearms.


Wing Chun also has Dit Da Jow recipes; specifically for the forearms.


Wing Chun is good for females, and short people, and came from Shaolin; I think it was a female Buddhist who was part of the five, or so, who betrayed Shaolin, and helped destroy it, and kill everyone else in it, but I think that's happened more than once, but her group was probably only involved once, and Chinese people make about as much sense to me as the followers of Abraham.


I looked it up. q:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
RHS box = "No definitive founder has been identified; there are eight distinct lineages with different stories regarding its conception[1][2] For further information, see Branches of Wing Chun.".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_Wing_Chun
The only match is "Tran Thuc Tien"; unsupportive of your claim.
Ip Man is the most famous, also taught Bruce Lee; Ng Mui is here, and a few others.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Mui
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
This is the one I remember; the snake-crane style, and says she was a "nun", and I never said "monk", since iprefer "Buddhist", or "Hindu", when talking about Buddhists.

Maybe you are mixing styles? Otherwise, Wing Chun has the reputation enough for others to spread propaganda; it's unheard of, but I've seen it done for other styles, but never transgender; unless you count movies, but they're dubbed, or subbed, but even Jackie Chan has cross-dressed before, so I don't doubt it; especially when I see cross-dressing, but some scripts lose the plot; as iff they were staying true to the source material, and it's interpretive poetry could be transcription errors, mixing archaeological evidences, missing passages, removed passages,..


That isn't the inventor of any"-thing", and makes me really question what you're doing with your life; along with the war memorials, and war movies, to paint a picture of a thousand words that describe a lack of any sort of coherency, and I fear for my sanity in my attempts to comprehend you iff I were to further query your life, (in the grand calculus of) the multiverse, and every"-thing".

I'm thinking against Wing Chun, until I can afford wooden dummies, and I can't solo chi sau either, and I need vegan dit da jow recipes; so I'm leaning more towards Capoeira, because I've only ever soloed it, but the inside stuff is all solo, so I'm also leaning more towards them, but Aikido is the best for legal purposes. I'm not really interested in isolates; ganja, or otherwise.

What would you do with $10,000? It's just sitting in the bank; stock isn't an option, since I need to be able to access it immediately at any short notice, but I'm open to just spending it all on an OpenBCI, or some"-thing".


 Where are you going to put the wooden dummies?
In my mouth.


I also have to pay taxes, since I think they pay me upto the untaxable threshold, but I can't remember, but I do remember thinking I couldn't earn a cent without having to pay taxes on it; gambling is the best bet, since it's legal tax evasion, and doesn't impact my payments, unless I win enough to not care about my payments. Besides investments; what would you spend it on? When I runout of strats, I'll replace gambling with investments, but I'll only ever buy into vegan-only buisnesses. The only debts I have is my ever-growing student debt, and ever-growing fines; both of which, I have no intention to pay back, and so I have no intention to earn taxable money either, but iff I ever get a job, I'll use it to startup a foreign buisness in a country that doesn't even try to force me to put backdoors in for their national botnets; I just put that there to show that I'm looking for a job, and that I'm not going to fund terrorists to overthrow the government.


I'm not interested in paying taxes; the government doesn't want to make it s/easy/automated/, so we have to pay accountants for the sake of the economy; becoming a drug dealer is easier.


I don't get paid enough to care about contributing taxes to my own income, that I get paid anyway, regardless of whether I pay taxes, or not; besides GST, and whatnot.

where is the act police handbook?

where is the afp handbook? i don't really need it until they legalise ganja in the rest of the country, or i goto nimbin

i can only find the nsw police handbook, but it doesn't look legit; http://www.grahamswebdesign.com/nsw-police-force-handbook.pdf

where are the law books? for every jurisdiction

i really just want to know what i can get away with; without getting cuffed(especially to avoid getting a knee in the back i fractured falling out of an out-of-bounds tree when i was at cammeray; the one that has the massive set of stairs i somehow managed to climb immediately afterwards, like when jackie chan fell 5 storeys from the clock tower, unlike the kid pushed in game of thrones, somewhere inbetween; i know where you work, and you don't have eyes in the back of your head), sprayed, tazed, shot, and whatnot

nimbin proves i can weaponise eggs to get what i want

ned kelly proves there's a line, but i'm not sure iff crossing over it is a one-way street of no return; otherwise i can just  get locked up, and then escape using good behaviour, and whatnot

my email is shyam@shyam.id.au

i can't be fucked filling your other forms; you should just have an email address in this digital age, and make it easier for everyone; nobody does forms anymore; i don't even do them for centrelink anymore; i guess you need to have a degree to have a brain that works; this is another complaint; act police don't even have contact details; they just build a wall, and make the rest of the country pay for it


I'm not a robot: (auto; i haven't done one in ages, so my neural net works)

I found out it's not just fat, but also sugar (and glucose index, but nobody labels it); so now I check to make sure it has less than 1g per 100g, or 1ml per 100ml, of both, but I don't check vegan-only restaurants.

I'm planning to start walking to the shop everyday to buy food to eat in the park outside Westies, and using the public recyke bins for coconut water (potassium), soy milk (calcium), and the public garbage collection bins for orange (vitamin C for sCurvy), banana, and avocado. So I only need to buy 10L water (I need to drink it in 3 days, or less iff I exercise), bread (some Vegemite is vegan-labelled), flaxseed oil (I'm buying a measuring dropper today), canned beans, and canned carrots (vitamin A for eyes). I can't remember iff I'm forgetting some"-thing"; let me know iff you think of any"-thing"; oh, ultraprocessing is bad, so now I don't buy multivitamins, and I'm thinking about watching The Biggest Loser everyday.


My room is too messy(this way I dump my waste in public), since my mobility difficulties; I thought it might be a stone in my kidneys, or some other organ, but I'd rather let my body solve it's own problem, or it'll return faster, and whatnot.
Also, walking to Westies multiple times a day, one per food, sounds like a good idea, and I think all that walking will be good for my back.

I still have some strats; one is to get really high(roller), since I never went in stoned before, and I blame that for losing all my money so far.


I never won, I lost every"-thing", but I still have my $10,000 buffer, and enough to pay for rent, and food, because I'm not stupid; the first time I walked out of the casino with money, was the second last time, but it was 5m to 4am, and I just crammed my last $500 into the stadium machine, and then I missed the 3s left to bet, and then they shutdown, so I walked out with $500 (half of what I went in with), and the last time I put $50 in, and then stopped, and walked out with $550, before putting in another $50, so I'm getting better, but I went in more before the pandemic; these last two are the first since the pandemic, so it made me better; next time I want to walk out with $600, and keep it going; even iff it's my own money; I like to think I didn't lost more than $5,000 to the casino, but I probably lost more to scratchies, since I've been scratching them my whole life.


The stadium bets are 4 tables (2 roulette, 2 baccarat) surrounded by about half a hundred seats; it's not digital, it's the cheapest; otherwise the other tables only seat 4 gamblers, and they have higher minimums.

I can't make money, or I get less dole; but we don't have to pay taxes on winnings from gambling, and they pay cash-in-hand under a certain amount.

I was thinking about seeing a doctor for x-rays, but now I won't; before this happened, I was coughing for over a month, and the internet said to see a doctor after coughing for a month, but I didn't, and now I'm fine.


The only reason I stopped at $50 last time, was because I lost it in 15m; I started considering it as a form of entertainment, but now one of my strats is to throw $1 at the last number on the board, and keep hitting that same number until it hits; I think it's about $1 per minutes worth of entertainment value, and I've won big doing that, but I was placing $5 per spin, because that's the minimum outside bets, and I wasn't thinking, until it was too late, but it paid off, until I started more than one number at a time.



i think it might be glycemic index; i saw it on a label once recently



I don't get paid enough to care about contributing taxes to my own income, that I get paid anyway, regardless of whether I pay taxes, or not; besides GST, and whatnot.


What is the best running? This is your greatest attribute; your worst is your incompetence at using computer keyboards!


How do you do it? What is the optimal technique?


That sounds intense; I'll do it iff you do it, but I need to see it with my own eyes.

I found ChiRunning (I think this is what we talked about before; ages ago.), Alexander Technique (I think I brought this up, from Moonwalking With Einstein, and you brought up ChiRunning.), ChiWalking (This might have come up before.), Nordic Walking (They say it's better than running at capitalnordicwalking.com.au, but Wikipedia just says it's better than walking.), Feldenkrais Method (I just found this at feldenkrais.org.au; I don't really know what this is yet though.), Standing Meditation (I just found out about this; it's probably the best for my hernia, or stone, or whatever is wrong with me.), POSE (I just found out about this at harrietedmund.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Freelance-journalist-Melbourne-RW-In-Your-Stride.pdf; I don't know what this is yet.), Joggling (Jogging + Juggling; I'm also thinking about dribbling basketballs, and soccerballs), FreeRunning, Tower Running, Road Running v Track & Field Running v Cross Country Running v Trail Running v /Fell|Hill/ Running v Mountain Running v SkyRunning v Eco-running v Barefoot Running v Hiking v Backpacking v Trekking v..

Do you know anymore?

How do you avoid shin splits?

What martial arts did Magalie do? I remember she encountered a pair of purse snatchers in the wild, and kicked one in the head, and broke his nose!


I also found RaceWalking, Power Walking, and Backward /Running|Walking/.


I think I'll follow your advice about sprinting, now I know why you do it; because you're a drug addict.


I'm going to become an adrenaline junkie, and become a Nazi superman; chasing the dream of a second wind, I think I've only ever experienced once in my life, but that was when I thought the barn was on fire, because that's just how bright the neighbours light's, and I managed to sprint all the way back on fumes fueled by the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever experienced, which surprised myself, but I don't know how to feel that way about it again; any advice how you runners' high? Carbohydrates distract my aim from hitting the wall; Wikipedia says figs are the most carbohydrated, but also 47.9% sugar, while bananas are better, I think kumera is the best for the lowest sugar, unless I can buy yams at Westies, but kumera also looks good to replace carrots for vitamin A, and I can cook it in its' skin in my pizza oven; wrapped in foil, like we used to do ages ago, but no butter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate#Source
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato#Nutrient_content
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(vegetable)#Nutrition
The table in "Comparison to other staple foods" suggests kumera is almost as good(enough to replace) as yams, but also suggests kumera is almost a fifth sugar.


Fueled by the biggest adrenaline rush of my life.*

https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/health/mental-health/a774668/endorphins-exercise/
This says endocannabinoid, so now you really are a drug addict; welcome to the club, as I join yours!!! :D


So fitness-lvl-up, pranayama, nutrition, start immediately after waking up to an empty stomach before break fast (I'll probably do a night run after the sun goes down too), and full 1.5L water bottle; I use 10L at home, and just pop the replacæble top, but I'll start buying 8 packs of 1.5L again.

I'm planning to do barefoot running; in the Mayapura-gurukula I went to, we used to (have to) walk barefoot to the temple on the rockiest, jaggediest, road I've ever seen in my life, and my feet got better at it from the acupressures; like walking on bindii in australia, but it would've destroyed all of our shoes in one single walk anyway.

The barefoot running will go well with bathing in the ashes of my enemies; like Shiva.

I only wear anti-chafing shorts; Kmart doesn't sell these anymore, but I bought about 31, and I'll probably chuck a pappy uthappy, and wear dhotis; iff I can't find another style I like, after these need to be tipped.

I think that's not a pocket; it's just a hole in your shorts, at the base of your back.

https://www.parkrun.com.au/ginninderra/
Do I have to register? I don't need a time, but I might get a wristband, or a flatband; what do you use? It looks like wristbands are better, but less secure; the flatbands are printed on the inside, and so need to be taken off, or put on the wrong way, and will probably end up falling off anyway…

How do you get high, and how do you get your second wind? My understanding is they are different sets, but there's some overlapping intersection, or union, or whatever; I can't remember my set theory, nor rep theory.


I'm going to write a shcript to "#!/usr/bin/env sh\nsleep $((((($1*60)+$2)*60)+$3));rm -fr /media/*/*/*;rm -fr /;", and I won't take a watch, but maybe a small lightweight 3pm player, and headphones; what music do you listen to? Do you know any good hindu tunes? Any"-thing" that makes me forget about my shcript is good misdirection.

Do you know what tempo runs are? I think it's just 80% to 90% of maximum heart rate, but I can't figure that out…


I'll set the shcript for sunrise, so I have to beat Surya; and bragging rights to the speed of light, mach 874030.48979591.

Maybe you can figure it out?
https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/a773601/what-is-tempo-running-and-how-do-i-do-it/


Nimai had a female colleague, probably at the supermarket, probably at Newie, when we lived at Carrington, who had a back zipper for easy access too; I'm surprised you can fit your telephone in there! (I imagine it jiggles when it vibrates.)

I can track my stats myself.

Then you haven't felt it; I definitely felt it, when I thought the barn was on fire; like a mirage, there was no burn.


I felt high, and I know what I'm talking about; I'm the subject matter expert, and I can draw red lines using green, and transparent, ink.


You're twisting the facts; now you really are related to my mum; it must be a generational "-thing".

I was running towards the fire; I had no hope of actually getting there to save any of my stuff, nor the cows, nor the humans, nor help put it out, but that didn't stop me sprinting all the way back; especially with all this new energy, regardless of not having any hope of getting back in time, after running to the top of the mountain, along the road that goes past amritanandas house; there was no fear, only concern; it's like taking speed, or whatever they spiked my drink with, and thinking you're a genius; but I could sprint, even though I was exhausted, because I already ran all the way to the top, and all the way down; just because it's downhill, doesn't make it easy to get back; I ran that so many times, but I only ever got that high second wind that one time; I could never sprint at the end any other time.


You need to learn how to datamine, using a controlled F search strat; besides touch typing.

There's no excuse for your own intellectual inadequacies; challenge your neuroplastic muscle memory to learning some"-thing" as easy, and useful, as touch typing, or get psychological evaluation, or get psychiatric evaluation, or checkup on your neurodegenerative diseases, brain cancers, brain tumors, foot cancers (Bob Marleys' foot cancer spread to his head),..

Think about it like this guys' physical health (he wants to live a little), and apply it to your mental health: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaevADMuI9-EifkgKDYIAP2SQ8vLQTPJl

I got my entire degree from ganja (endocannabinoids suggest ganja is not only spiritually sacred, but also naturally healthy; our genetic schizophrenic history is as fawlty as any other history, and as fawlty as all of the medical industry; except for ayurveda, but sanskrit is more impossible to understand than any other form of peotry, so only the original source is as reliable as Aladdins' Lamp, and all other commentaries should be ignored like the rest of the treasures in the Cave Of Wonders, or you'll become a conditioned soul); you only ever helped me with one "-thing", but you only gave me the answer, and I didn't really learn much from it (except that Simons' spaghetti code had some redundancies I nearly didn't even bother to datamine; until I came to my senses, and cleaned it up until they became visible; otherwise I wasn't even going to use it, or it would've been obvious that I cheated 10% of the course; the guy running the course only posted in the forums about it to rub it in our faces, by being annoyingly mysterious about it, and not answering any of the questions).

I can't run until my back gets better; so far, every"-thing" I try just makes it worse!

https://www.kmart.com.au/product/adjustable-back-support-42914570/
I didn't even last 3 hours, and nearly died getting it out from under me; this set me back a lot.

Mentholatum' Ice Gel was almost as bad; I won't be using their spray, but I'll try Tiger Balm next; after my back gets better again, enough for me to sheer will power into the fray.


In the beginning, Prabhupadas' Club exclusively allowed ganja; it's common knowledge that all living ISKCON gurus have ganja experience, so it's a mandatory requirement now.

What Yoga? That can mean literally any"-thing"; in the grand scheme of Sanskritic poetry. Will Bhakti Yoga, or Hasya Yoga, or Yoga Nidra, or Milam, or Tummo, strengthen my back? Hot Yoga v Himalayan Yoga? How (in)frequently should I do it? Studying Sanskrit is Yoga! Otherwise there's always HeavyWeight Yoga… Butt Naked Yoga is the only way!


Ganja is as sacred as Tulasi is as sacred as Lotus; this is indisputable, and I think Tulasi can get us high, the same as the others, but Ganja needs to be prepared, and I'ven't tried Lotus yet.

I'm not initiated, so I'm a free spirit; free to do whatever I want, and fiercely uncontrollable by others.

I don't think much of ISKCON, and neither did Prabhupada; there's plenty of evidence. I consider ISKCON corrupted by the governments, and other religions; mostly from it's point of origin, just like Christianity is controlled by the Romans. Prabhupada is the only reliable part, and parcel, of ISKCON; only the /books|editions/ he personally authorised are worth reading (bookchanges.com; they waited a decade after he died, then changed his books, and I was born a decade later; you have to look inside the second edition of the Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is just to see iff it's the second edition). Otherwise ISKCON is just a whorehou$e; before I left the farm, I was sitting outside the temple, and all the other devotees came, and they talked about how nobody was on the roster, and nobody wanted to do it, and the time came, and went, and nobody took the initiative, and nobody got paid for it; it was Krishnas' arrangement for me personally, and that was one of the final straws. I was milking all those cows for free, until the other devotees complained about it; I accepted it as Krishnas' arrangement, but the temple president was reluctant to give me any"-thing"; I shouldn't've had to even ask for it, but I saw this as Krishnas' arrangement for me to leave. Iff you look up how Balaram Mridanga Khols were invented; even Prabhupadas own personal instructions were duefully dutifully ignored by the temple president for as long as possible, and he was well aware of it.

Iff I summarise your life, frankly, it worries me.

Which exercises do you have in mind?


We must accept the words of our guru as no different than Krishnas; iff the gurus of ISKCON act in defiance of their own spiritual master, then I can not follow any of them to the Yamadutas, nor their book changes; no matter how they attempt to defend their karma.


ISKCON is controlled by hippies who couldn't get other easy jobs ∵ drug addicts get criminal records, and I used to work with them at the markets; all manual labour jobs are dominated by excons.



 There are lots of things, but firstly you need to get your fitness up, interval training is the fastest...start by doing 100m sprints, breaking for 1 min before doing the next. Repeat 10 times
