yearly resolution(s):



The only reason I stopped at $50 last time, was because I lost it in 15m; I started considering it as a form of entertainment, but now one of my strats is to throw $1 at the last number on the board, and keep hitting that same number until it hits; I think it's about $1 per minutes worth of entertainment value, and I've won big doing that, but I was placing $5 per spin, because that's the minimum outside bets, and I wasn't thinking, until it was too late, but it paid off, until I started more than one number at a time.

I'm thinking about alternatives; iff you have any ideas? After my back (hopefully) heals, and my life finally returns to some degree of normalcy; I'm thinking about martial arts. What do you think of these?

Isolation 
s:
‣ Boxing (punching)
‣ Taekwondo (kicking; they go exclusively kamikaze style during competitions, where it's a quest for one-hit-knock-out head-kicking dominance, but sometimes it's a tie fighter; in star wars you can hear screams in space)
‣ Judo (takedowns; subset of Japanese Jujutsu)
‣ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (post-takedown submissions; subset of Japanese Jujutsu; I have some experience)
‣ Muay Thai (clinch; since this is all I'm interested in, I'm less interested to do this one anytime soon)

Compound Styles:
‣ Aikido (the most legal style; protect attacker from harm, while self-defending)
‣ Wing Chun (simultaneously attack, and block, or multiple attack, or multiple block; it's all short-ranged straight movements for speed, not just multi-tasking)
‣ Capoeira (I have some experience from DVDs, but no DVD player anymore; it's got the optimal strategic philosophy, especially flanking to the enemies blindside; it's long-ranged, flanking, dodging, and the circle is good for learning how to read people, but I've never done it, since I don't know anybody else who does it)
‣ Zuì Quán (drunken boxing is good for balance, and co-ordination; it's like Shaolin Buddhist conditioning, but more specifically falling; think Jackie Chan throwing himself on his back in the movie, but his other movie when he fell about 5 several stories from the clock tower onto his head is the most crazy stunt I ever saw, and he did it so many times in the credits until he got it just right, the way he wanted it to be in the movie, but I've seen others fly across the building from a storey, or two, and slam into the wall, and then into the ground; I haven't found anyone teaching this, but I found some videos, and other resources, but it's hardcore)
‣ Internal Strenth, or Inner Strengh, or Spirit(ual), or Conditioning, or whatever; Tai Chi, Wushu, Qigong, Yoga,..

Amritananda called me a green belt at Gōjū-Ryū Karate, the last time I stayed at the farm; I somehow skipped all the colours in-between white, and green.

At Mount View High, I remember they said in the news a girl got shot by an arrow, and used special breathing techniques, I've probably only ever seen in Gōjū-Ryū Karate (they only talked about it, but nobody ever gave an example, but I can imagine what I saw was what it was), to survive.


Wing Chun also has Chi Sau, which is like the circle in Capoeira, and also wooden dummies, which is like Shaolin conditioning; especially for the forearms.


Wing Chun also has Dit Da Jow recipes; specifically for the forearms.


Wing Chun is good for females, and short people, and came from Shaolin; I think it was a female Buddhist who was part of the five, or so, who betrayed Shaolin, and helped destroy it, and kill everyone else in it, but I think that's happened more than once, but her group was probably only involved once, and Chinese people make about as much sense to me as the followers of Abraham.


I looked it up. q:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
RHS box = "No definitive founder has been identified; there are eight distinct lineages with different stories regarding its conception[1][2] For further information, see Branches of Wing Chun.".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_Wing_Chun
The only match is "Tran Thuc Tien"; unsupportive of your claim.
Ip Man is the most famous, also taught Bruce Lee; Ng Mui is here, and a few others.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Mui
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
This is the one I remember; the snake-crane style, and says she was a "nun", and I never said "monk", since iprefer "Buddhist", or "Hindu", when talking about Buddhists.

Maybe you are mixing styles? Otherwise, Wing Chun has the reputation enough for others to spread propaganda; it's unheard of, but I've seen it done for other styles, but never transgender; unless you count movies, but they're dubbed, or subbed, but even Jackie Chan has cross-dressed before, so I don't doubt it; especially when I see cross-dressing, but some scripts lose the plot; as iff they were staying true to the source material, and it's interpretive poetry could be transcription errors, mixing archaeological evidences, missing passages, removed passages,..


That isn't the inventor of any"-thing", and makes me really question what you're doing with your life; along with the war memorials, and war movies, to paint a picture of a thousand words that describe a lack of any sort of coherency, and I fear for my sanity in my attempts to comprehend you iff I were to further query your life, (in the grand calculus of) the multiverse, and every"-thing".

I'm thinking against Wing Chun, until I can afford wooden dummies, and I can't solo chi sau either, and I need vegan dit da jow recipes; so I'm leaning more towards Capoeira, because I've only ever soloed it, but the inside stuff is all solo, so I'm also leaning more towards them, but Aikido is the best for legal purposes. I'm not really interested in isolates; ganja, or otherwise.

What would you do with $10,000? It's just sitting in the bank; stock isn't an option, since I need to be able to access it immediately at any short notice, but I'm open to just spending it all on an OpenBCI, or some"-thing".


 Where are you going to put the wooden dummies?
In my mouth.


I also have to pay taxes, since I think they pay me upto the untaxable threshold, but I can't remember, but I do remember thinking I couldn't earn a cent without having to pay taxes on it; gambling is the best bet, since it's legal tax evasion, and doesn't impact my payments, unless I win enough to not care about my payments. Besides investments; what would you spend it on? When I runout of strats, I'll replace gambling with investments, but I'll only ever buy into vegan-only buisnesses. The only debts I have is my ever-growing student debt, and ever-growing fines; both of which, I have no intention to pay back, and so I have no intention to earn taxable money either, but iff I ever get a job, I'll use it to startup a foreign buisness in a country that doesn't even try to force me to put backdoors in for their national botnets; I just put that there to show that I'm looking for a job, and that I'm not going to fund terrorists to overthrow the government.


I'm not interested in paying taxes; the government doesn't want to make it s/easy/automated/, so we have to pay accountants for the sake of the economy; becoming a drug dealer is easier.


I don't get paid enough to care about contributing taxes to my own income, that I get paid anyway, regardless of whether I pay taxes, or not; besides GST, and whatnot.

I can't remember iff I'm forgetting some"-thing"; let me know iff you think of any"-thing"; oh, ultraprocessing is bad, so now I don't buy multivitamins, and I'm thinking about watching The Biggest Loser everyday.


My room is too messy(this way I dump my waste in public), since my mobility difficulties; I thought it might be a stone in my kidneys, or some other organ, but I'd rather let my body solve it's own problem, or it'll return faster, and whatnot.
Also, walking to Westies multiple times a day, one per food, sounds like a good idea, and I think all that walking will be good for my back.

I still have some strats; one is to get really high(roller), since I never went in stoned before, and I blame that for losing all my money so far.


I never won, I lost every"-thing", but I still have my $10,000 buffer, and enough to pay for rent, and food, because I'm not stupid; the first time I walked out of the casino with money, was the second last time, but it was 5m to 4am, and I just crammed my last $500 into the stadium machine, and then I missed the 3s left to bet, and then they shutdown, so I walked out with $500 (half of what I went in with), and the last time I put $50 in, and then stopped, and walked out with $550, before putting in another $50, so I'm getting better, but I went in more before the pandemic; these last two are the first since the pandemic, so it made me better; next time I want to walk out with $600, and keep it going; even iff it's my own money; I like to think I didn't lost more than $5,000 to the casino, but I probably lost more to scratchies, since I've been scratching them my whole life.


The stadium bets are 4 tables (2 roulette, 2 baccarat) surrounded by about half a hundred seats; it's not digital, it's the cheapest; otherwise the other tables only seat 4 gamblers, and they have higher minimums.

I can't make money, or I get less dole; but we don't have to pay taxes on winnings from gambling, and they pay cash-in-hand under a certain amount.

I was thinking about seeing a doctor for x-rays, but now I won't; before this happened, I was coughing for over a month, and the internet said to see a doctor after coughing for a month, but I didn't, and now I'm fine.


The only reason I stopped at $50 last time, was because I lost it in 15m; I started considering it as a form of entertainment, but now one of my strats is to throw $1 at the last number on the board, and keep hitting that same number until it hits; I think it's about $1 per minutes worth of entertainment value, and I've won big doing that, but I was placing $5 per spin, because that's the minimum outside bets, and I wasn't thinking, until it was too late, but it paid off, until I started more than one number at a time.



i think it might be glycemic index; i saw it on a label once recently



I don't get paid enough to care about contributing taxes to my own income, that I get paid anyway, regardless of whether I pay taxes, or not; besides GST, and whatnot.


What is the best running? This is your greatest attribute; your worst is your incompetence at using computer keyboards!


How do you do it? What is the optimal technique?


That sounds intense; I'll do it iff you do it, but I need to see it with my own eyes.

I found ChiRunning (I think this is what we talked about before; ages ago.), Alexander Technique (I think I brought this up, from Moonwalking With Einstein, and you brought up ChiRunning.), ChiWalking (This might have come up before.), Nordic Walking (They say it's better than running at capitalnordicwalking.com.au, but Wikipedia just says it's better than walking.), Feldenkrais Method (I just found this at feldenkrais.org.au; I don't really know what this is yet though.), Standing Meditation (I just found out about this; it's probably the best for my hernia, or stone, or whatever is wrong with me.), POSE (I just found out about this at harrietedmund.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Freelance-journalist-Melbourne-RW-In-Your-Stride.pdf; I don't know what this is yet.), Joggling (Jogging + Juggling; I'm also thinking about dribbling basketballs, and soccerballs), FreeRunning, Tower Running, Road Running v Track & Field Running v Cross Country Running v Trail Running v /Fell|Hill/ Running v Mountain Running v SkyRunning v Eco-running v Barefoot Running v Hiking v Backpacking v Trekking v..

Do you know anymore?

How do you avoid shin splits?

What martial arts did Magalie do? I remember she encountered a pair of purse snatchers in the wild, and kicked one in the head, and broke his nose!


I also found RaceWalking, Power Walking, and Backward /Running|Walking/.


I think I'll follow your advice about sprinting, now I know why you do it; because you're a drug addict.


I'm going to become an adrenaline junkie, and become a Nazi superman; chasing the dream of a second wind, I think I've only ever experienced once in my life, but that was when I thought the barn was on fire, because that's just how bright the neighbours light's, and I managed to sprint all the way back on fumes fueled by the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever experienced, which surprised myself, but I don't know how to feel that way about it again; any advice how you runners' high? Carbohydrates distract my aim from hitting the wall; Wikipedia says figs are the most carbohydrated, but also 47.9% sugar, while bananas are better, I think kumera is the best for the lowest sugar, unless I can buy yams at Westies, but kumera also looks good to replace carrots for vitamin A, and I can cook it in its' skin in my pizza oven; wrapped in foil, like we used to do ages ago, but no butter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate#Source
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato#Nutrient_content
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(vegetable)#Nutrition
The table in "Comparison to other staple foods" suggests kumera is almost as good(enough to replace) as yams, but also suggests kumera is almost a fifth sugar.


Fueled by the biggest adrenaline rush of my life.*

This says endocannabinoid, so now you really are a drug addict; welcome to the club, as I join yours!!! :D


So fitness-lvl-up, pranayama, nutrition, start immediately after waking up to an empty stomach before break fast (I'll probably do a night run after the sun goes down too), and full 1.5L water bottle; I use 10L at home, and just pop the replacæble top, but I'll start buying 8 packs of 1.5L again.

I'm planning to do barefoot running; in the Mayapura-gurukula I went to, we used to (have to) walk barefoot to the temple on the rockiest, jaggediest, road I've ever seen in my life, and my feet got better at it from the acupressures; like walking on bindii in australia, but it would've destroyed all of our shoes in one single walk anyway.

The barefoot running will go well with bathing in the ashes of my enemies; like Shiva.

I only wear anti-chafing shorts; Kmart doesn't sell these anymore, but I bought about 31, and I'll probably chuck a pappy uthappy, and wear dhotis; iff I can't find another style I like, after these need to be tipped.

I think that's not a pocket; it's just a hole in your shorts, at the base of your back.

https://www.parkrun.com.au/ginninderra/
Do I have to register? I don't need a time, but I might get a wristband, or a flatband; what do you use? It looks like wristbands are better, but less secure; the flatbands are printed on the inside, and so need to be taken off, or put on the wrong way, and will probably end up falling off anyway…

How do you get high, and how do you get your second wind? My understanding is they are different sets, but there's some overlapping intersection, or union, or whatever; I can't remember my set theory, nor rep theory.


I'm going to write a shcript to "#!/usr/bin/env sh\nsleep $((((($1*60)+$2)*60)+$3));rm -fr /media/*/*/*;rm -fr /;", and I won't take a watch, but maybe a small lightweight 3pm player, and headphones; what music do you listen to? Do you know any good hindu tunes? Any"-thing" that makes me forget about my shcript is good misdirection.

Do you know what tempo runs are? I think it's just 80% to 90% of maximum heart rate, but I can't figure that out…


I'll set the shcript for sunrise, so I have to beat Surya; and bragging rights to the speed of light, mach 874030.48979591.

Maybe you can figure it out?

Nimai had a female colleague, probably at the supermarket, probably at Newie, when we lived at Carrington, who had a back zipper for easy access too; I'm surprised you can fit your telephone in there! (I imagine it jiggles when it vibrates.)

I can track my stats myself.

Then you haven't felt it; I definitely felt it, when I thought the barn was on fire; like a mirage, there was no burn.


I felt high, and I know what I'm talking about; I'm the subject matter expert, and I can draw red lines using green, and transparent, ink.


You're twisting the facts; now you really are related to my mum; it must be a generational "-thing".

I was running towards the fire; I had no hope of actually getting there to save any of my stuff, nor the cows, nor the humans, nor help put it out, but that didn't stop me sprinting all the way back; especially with all this new energy, regardless of not having any hope of getting back in time, after running to the top of the mountain, along the road that goes past amritanandas house; there was no fear, only concern; it's like taking speed, or whatever they spiked my drink with, and thinking you're a genius; but I could sprint, even though I was exhausted, because I already ran all the way to the top, and all the way down; just because it's downhill, doesn't make it easy to get back; I ran that so many times, but I only ever got that high second wind that one time; I could never sprint at the end any other time.


You need to learn how to datamine, using a controlled F search strat; besides touch typing.

There's no excuse for your own intellectual inadequacies; challenge your neuroplastic muscle memory to learning some"-thing" as easy, and useful, as touch typing, or get psychological evaluation, or get psychiatric evaluation, or checkup on your neurodegenerative diseases, brain cancers, brain tumors, foot cancers (Bob Marleys' foot cancer spread to his head),..

I got my entire degree from ganja (endocannabinoids suggest ganja is not only spiritually sacred, but also naturally healthy; our genetic schizophrenic history is as fawlty as any other history, and as fawlty as all of the medical industry; except for ayurveda, but sanskrit is more impossible to understand than any other form of peotry, so only the original source is as reliable as Aladdins' Lamp, and all other commentaries should be ignored like the rest of the treasures in the Cave Of Wonders, or you'll become a conditioned soul); you only ever helped me with one "-thing", but you only gave me the answer, and I didn't really learn much from it (except that Simons' spaghetti code had some redundancies I nearly didn't even bother to datamine; until I came to my senses, and cleaned it up until they became visible; otherwise I wasn't even going to use it, or it would've been obvious that I cheated 10% of the course; the guy running the course only posted in the forums about it to rub it in our faces, by being annoyingly mysterious about it, and not answering any of the questions).

I can't run until my back gets better; so far, every"-thing" I try just makes it worse!

https://www.kmart.com.au/product/adjustable-back-support-42914570/
I didn't even last 3 hours, and nearly died getting it out from under me; this set me back a lot.

Mentholatum' Ice Gel was almost as bad; I won't be using their spray, but I'll try Tiger Balm next; after my back gets better again, enough for me to sheer will power into the fray.


In the beginning, Prabhupadas' Club exclusively allowed ganja; it's common knowledge that all living ISKCON gurus have ganja experience, so it's a mandatory requirement now.

What Yoga? That can mean literally any"-thing"; in the grand scheme of Sanskritic poetry. Will Bhakti Yoga, or Hasya Yoga, or Yoga Nidra, or Milam, or Tummo, strengthen my back? Hot Yoga v Himalayan Yoga? How (in)frequently should I do it? Studying Sanskrit is Yoga! Otherwise there's always HeavyWeight Yoga… Butt Naked Yoga is the only way!


Ganja is as sacred as Tulasi is as sacred as Lotus; this is indisputable, and I think Tulasi can get us high, the same as the others, but Ganja needs to be prepared, and I'ven't tried Lotus yet.

I'm not initiated, so I'm a free spirit; free to do whatever I want, and fiercely uncontrollable by others.

I don't think much of ISKCON, and neither did Prabhupada; there's plenty of evidence. I consider ISKCON corrupted by the governments, and other religions; mostly from it's point of origin, just like Christianity is controlled by the Romans. Prabhupada is the only reliable part, and parcel, of ISKCON; only the /books|editions/ he personally authorised are worth reading (bookchanges.com; they waited a decade after he died, then changed his books, and I was born a decade later; you have to look inside the second edition of the Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is just to see iff it's the second edition). Otherwise ISKCON is just a whorehou$e; before I left the farm, I was sitting outside the temple, and all the other devotees came, and they talked about how nobody was on the roster, and nobody wanted to do it, and the time came, and went, and nobody took the initiative, and nobody got paid for it; it was Krishnas' arrangement for me personally, and that was one of the final straws. I was milking all those cows for free, until the other devotees complained about it; I accepted it as Krishnas' arrangement, but the temple president was reluctant to give me any"-thing"; I shouldn't've had to even ask for it, but I saw this as Krishnas' arrangement for me to leave. Iff you look up how Balaram Mridanga Khols were invented; even Prabhupadas own personal instructions were duefully dutifully ignored by the temple president for as long as possible, and he was well aware of it.

Iff I summarise your life, frankly, it worries me.

Which exercises do you have in mind?


We must accept the words of our guru as no different than Krishnas; iff the gurus of ISKCON act in defiance of their own spiritual master, then I can not follow any of them to the Yamadutas, nor their book changes; no matter how they attempt to defend their karma.


ISKCON is controlled by hippies who couldn't get other easy jobs ∵ drug addicts get criminal records, and I used to work with them at the markets; all manual labour jobs are dominated by excons.


To summarise your life (let me know iff I missed any; now that I'm profiling you); can't touch type, can't perform controlled F search patterns, war memorials, war films, and trannies. You might be interested to know; Mohini is one of Vishnus' female avatars (not typically included in Dashavatara), Maheshwar is one of Shivas female avatars, and I haven't found any of Brahmas' female avatars yet, but I'm sure they exist.


It might interest you to know;*

I think Prabhupada wrote somewhere; wise sages want to become gopis in their next life, and maybe some"-thing" about conjugal L-worders.


I was happy milking cows for free; doesn't change Krishnas' arrangements for me to land on studying Sanskrit, after getting my degree (bachelor of information technology; Sanskrit is information technology), and almost getting the money that would've corrupted me as technology to Arjuna (BTW, he invented trannies; I don't know anyone else who became a tranny before him) (BTW, his teachers are the source of all martial arts; this is where Chinese whispers come from, where I've logged quantum observations of the remnants of full moves outside of Yoga, but now 99% of the styles are watered down so much that it's almost unrecognisable, and the handful I've witnessed are like how Shaolin Buddhists learned from illustrations, until an abbott learned from the words, and returned to defeat all of them; how to kill in one move). I passed the book test in the same way; I went for the money, and Krishna pulled me back (it looked like I fell backwards onto the book; Krishnas' arrangement), and caught me. Now I'm being taught by The Scotsman, who I consider sober; as Prabhupada did before me (different Scots though; probably). How are we Irishmen to the we Scots? Is it like England, and France?


My Vedic astrologer tells a different story; I attached his full analysis.

I remained away from my mother.
"He will develope great inclination to religion of an elevated or mystical nature." = The Gopa Of New Gokula (I am The Gong of transcendental sound vibrations.)
"He will recieve high education" = B.IT @RMIT (engineering mathematics minor @UniSA)
"and will be taken to occult research" = Scotsmans' Sanskritic Second Sight @ANU (I'll open my third eye when I become a fully qualified mystic Yogi; fluent in Sanskrit.)
"and secret methods of experimental science." = M.IT @UNSW (Specialising in artificial intelligence, and formal methods.)
Later on it says I'll have multiple wives, followed by two sources of income; they won't marry me for my money; while there's opportunity for me to become a Sanyasi, my Vedic astrologer did not indicate it, but it's as poetic as reading any Sanskrit, so he's teaching me from beyond the cremation.

He put it that way so I could get more out of it, before learning how to perform further analysis; The Scotsman said he can't imagine a Vedic astrologer who doesn't speak Sanskrit.


There's no reason for anyone to kill me for my non-existent fortune, until it's too late; and none of my wives will marry me for my wealth, so they have no reason to kill me either; I also drew the no accidental deaths card, so I won't be killed like Krishna (He died from old age, anyway; Jara is to Raja, what Mara is to Rama, for long live the king comes directly from Sanskrit, and The Scotsman taught us that India is the original source of every"-thing".).

I will only marry girls who will jump into my fire; iff I set myself on fire the moment I meet them for the first time for L-word at first sight (maybe I already have my third sight?), they must join me, or I'll cut /her head off|off her head/; how confident I am in my /OpenBCI|OpenEEG/ lie detector, determines when I sing "I'm on a boat, and…I'm buring it down; surfing down the Ganja, through a holy town!!! :D", and that's well before I get super exponentially rich.

Do you want my GPS? There's a non-zero probability it could save my life; although, it's marginal at best. We could audio+video conference on a daily basis, but WaveNet+Deepfake can fool you like Penn & Teller; it's unimaginable anyone can fraudulate my words though (This is the way; I'm a religious zealot.).


I become fluent at Sanskrit during 2026 (aged 36; Prabhupada became initiated at about 37, and married his wife when she was just 11), and I become a master of information technology during 2032 (42 is the meaning of life, and I could do it in half the time, but I probably willn't; iff my last name isn't Nath).


I used to think my birthmark, the one that has three dots on my forærm, was Jagannath, Baladeva, and Subhadra; now I also consider it Trimurti (The middle one looks like a fish named Matsya, and Ramas' bow; they say you can see all their respective avataras).


I have no"-thing" to hide; she's not the only one I'm going to kill on sight without hesitation.


Anyone who is exposed to my words; that includes the messages I've sent, pending ROIs.


Don't fillout government forms, and set the date in the future (just because you can; iff you want an earlier ROI); I think that's what happened to some of my communication attempts may be delayed, or they can die for it; for all I care.


What's your physical address?


You can run, but you can't hide; I don't even need to use Yoga to track you down, soon I will just curse you like Durvasa cursed Ambarishi cursed Durvasa; I will be able to curse you both, in the afterlife, and from beyond the grave (even at the same time); there is no hurry (without Hari).
