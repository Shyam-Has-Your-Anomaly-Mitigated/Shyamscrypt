The only reason I stopped at $50 last time, was because I lost it in 15m; I started considering it as a form of entertainment, but now one of my strats is to throw $1 at the last number on the board, and keep hitting that same number until it hits; I think it's about $1 per minutes worth of entertainment value, and I've won big doing that, but I was placing $5 per spin, because that's the minimum outside bets, and I wasn't thinking, until it was too late, but it paid off, until I started more than one number at a time.

I'm thinking about alternatives; iff you have any ideas? After my back (hopefully) heals, and my life finally returns to some degree of normalcy; I'm thinking about martial arts. What do you think of these?

Isolation Styles:
‣ Boxing (punching)
‣ Taekwondo (kicking; they go exclusively kamikaze style during competitions, where it's a quest for one-hit-knock-out head-kicking dominance, but sometimes it's a tie fighter; in star wars you can hear screams in space)
‣ Judo (takedowns; subset of Japanese Jujutsu)
‣ Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (post-takedown submissions; subset of Japanese Jujutsu; I have some experience)
‣ Muay Thai (clinch; since this is all I'm interested in, I'm less interested to do this one anytime soon)

Compound Styles:
‣ Aikido (the most legal style; protect attacker from harm, while self-defending)
‣ Wing Chun (simultaneously attack, and block, or multiple attack, or multiple block; it's all short-ranged straight movements for speed, not just multi-tasking)
‣ Capoeira (I have some experience from DVDs, but no DVD player anymore; it's got the optimal strategic philosophy, especially flanking to the enemies blindside; it's long-ranged, flanking, dodging, and the circle is good for learning how to read people, but I've never done it, since I don't know anybody else who does it)
‣ Zuì Quán (drunken boxing is good for balance, and co-ordination; it's like Shaolin Buddhist conditioning, but more specifically falling; think Jackie Chan throwing himself on his back in the movie, but his other movie when he fell about 5 several stories from the clock tower onto his head is the most crazy stunt I ever saw, and he did it so many times in the credits until he got it just right, the way he wanted it to be in the movie, but I've seen others fly across the building from a storey, or two, and slam into the wall, and then into the ground; I haven't found anyone teaching this, but I found some videos, and other resources, but it's hardcore)
‣ Internal Strenth, or Inner Strengh, or Spirit(ual), or Conditioning, or whatever; Tai Chi, Wushu, Qigong, Yoga,..

Amritananda called me a green belt at Gōjū-Ryū Karate, the last time I stayed at the farm; I somehow skipped all the colours in-between white, and green.

At Mount View High, I remember they said in the news a girl got shot by an arrow, and used special breathing techniques, I've probably only ever seen in Gōjū-Ryū Karate (they only talked about it, but nobody ever gave an example, but I can imagine what I saw was what it was), to survive.


Wing Chun also has Chi Sau, which is like the circle in Capoeira, and also wooden dummies, which is like Shaolin conditioning; especially for the forearms.


Wing Chun also has Dit Da Jow recipes; specifically for the forearms.


Wing Chun is good for females, and short people, and came from Shaolin; I think it was a female Buddhist who was part of the five, or so, who betrayed Shaolin, and helped destroy it, and kill everyone else in it, but I think that's happened more than once, but her group was probably only involved once, and Chinese people make about as much sense to me as the followers of Abraham.


I looked it up. q:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
RHS box = "No definitive founder has been identified; there are eight distinct lineages with different stories regarding its conception[1][2] For further information, see Branches of Wing Chun.".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_Wing_Chun
The only match is "Tran Thuc Tien"; unsupportive of your claim.
Ip Man is the most famous, also taught Bruce Lee; Ng Mui is here, and a few others.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Mui
There are only two matches for "tran", neither support your claim.
This is the one I remember; the snake-crane style, and says she was a "nun", and I never said "monk", since iprefer "Buddhist", or "Hindu", when talking about Buddhists.

Maybe you are mixing styles? Otherwise, Wing Chun has the reputation enough for others to spread propaganda; it's unheard of, but I've seen it done for other styles, but never transgender; unless you count movies, but they're dubbed, or subbed, but even Jackie Chan has cross-dressed before, so I don't doubt it; especially when I see cross-dressing, but some scripts lose the plot; as iff they were staying true to the source material, and it's interpretive poetry could be transcription errors, mixing archaeological evidences, missing passages, removed passages,..


That isn't the inventor of any"-thing", and makes me really question what you're doing with your life; along with the war memorials, and war movies, to paint a picture of a thousand words that describe a lack of any sort of coherency, and I fear for my sanity in my attempts to comprehend you iff I were to further query your life, (in the grand calculus of) the multiverse, and every"-thing".

I'm thinking against Wing Chun, until I can afford wooden dummies, and I can't solo chi sau either, and I need vegan dit da jow recipes; so I'm leaning more towards Capoeira, because I've only ever soloed it, but the inside stuff is all solo, so I'm also leaning more towards them, but Aikido is the best for legal purposes. I'm not really interested in isolates; ganja, or otherwise.

What would you do with $10,000? It's just sitting in the bank; stock isn't an option, since I need to be able to access it immediately at any short notice, but I'm open to just spending it all on an OpenBCI, or some"-thing".


 Where are you going to put the wooden dummies?
In my mouth.


I also have to pay taxes, since I think they pay me upto the untaxable threshold, but I can't remember, but I do remember thinking I couldn't earn a cent without having to pay taxes on it; gambling is the best bet, since it's legal tax evasion, and doesn't impact my payments, unless I win enough to not care about my payments. Besides investments; what would you spend it on? When I runout of strats, I'll replace gambling with investments, but I'll only ever buy into vegan-only buisnesses. The only debts I have is my ever-growing student debt, and ever-growing fines; both of which, I have no intention to pay back, and so I have no intention to earn taxable money either, but iff I ever get a job, I'll use it to startup a foreign buisness in a country that doesn't even try to force me to put backdoors in for their national botnets; I just put that there to show that I'm looking for a job, and that I'm not going to fund terrorists to overthrow the government.


I'm not interested in paying taxes; the government doesn't want to make it s/easy/automated/, so we have to pay accountants for the sake of the economy; becoming a drug dealer is easier.


I don't get paid enough to care about contributing taxes to my own income, that I get paid anyway, regardless of whether I pay taxes, or not; besides GST, and whatnot.



now i know what to spend my $10,000 on; a wooden dummy
fine$ are the pin in my game of life's a game of chess

Complaint Details:

where is the act police handbook?

where is the afp handbook? i don't really need it until they legalise ganja in the rest of the country, or i goto nimbin

i can only find the nsw police handbook, but it doesn't look legit; http://www.grahamswebdesign.com/nsw-police-force-handbook.pdf

where are the law books? for every jurisdiction

i really just want to know what i can get away with; without getting cuffed(especially to avoid getting a knee in the back i fractured falling out of an out-of-bounds tree when i was at cammeray; the one that has the massive set of stairs i somehow managed to climb immediately afterwards, like when jackie chan fell 5 storeys from the clock tower, unlike the kid pushed in game of thrones, somewhere inbetween; i know where you work, and you don't have eyes in the back of your head), sprayed, tazed, shot, and whatnot

nimbin proves i can weaponise eggs to get what i want

ned kelly proves there's a line, but i'm not sure iff crossing over it is a one-way street of no return; otherwise i can just  get locked up, and then escape using good behaviour, and whatnot

my email is shyam@shyam.id.au

i can't be fucked filling your other forms; you should just have an email address in this digital age, and make it easier for everyone; nobody does forms anymore; i don't even do them for centrelink anymore; i guess you need to have a degree to have a brain that works; this is another complaint; act police don't even have contact details; they just build a wall, and make the rest of the country pay for it


I'm not a robot: (auto; i haven't done one in ages, so my neural net works)



fast & furiously puppeteering the government; i only need to send all the water trucks away from the banks #fight_club
bioweaponised gas leaks; vegan shit(ualities; double slit(ualities))



mccomaḥ will (apparently)die(apparently) ∴ i must /dotadiw|aladdin|a lad in (it|f?w)?/, and he must survive 12026; then i can train to cut trees like in minecraft, and maybe free trapped souls iff i interpretranslatenlightenment krishna re-leasing the sons of kuvera to support it; there's always bamboo,.. (i also want to jackie chan down trees, before i minecraft them down; following, the prometheus school of running away; after haka, followed by kiai #shenmue)
i will memorise both partsons of egeneḥ; hopefully before the placement test for sanskrit 3, or i'll just wing(chun) it
the book test is the story of my life; i went for the money (losing it all to the ca$ino), and now i fall back on the book that catches me (i cried, and then they gave me the money; maybe mccomaḥ dies, or i don't get into sanskrit /9|10/, but i get whatever i want; i need to (re)consult the kbs of my vedic astrology)
miranda is the only self-defence i need, before a licensed lawyer; whose legal advice, i'll ignore as government propaganda bio(weaponised)machined social engineering
i've settled for yoga; my fractured spine, /kidney|bladder|../ stone (i remember reading it causes lower back pain, but i can't find it, and can't be fucked; drinking lots of water is the cure), or surprise for you that i've got (uncle huggie thinks it might be a bulging disx; i looked it up as a hernia; spinal disc herniation), or whatever this is; is the sign as a symbolic gesture from maya #geT_cuddled
