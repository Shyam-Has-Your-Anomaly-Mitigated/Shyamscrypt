                        I might take on the military "tomorrow", when the war begins, for some extra fire power; I was a good shot in the cadets, ever since day one (the instructor supervised me, and pseudo got up, by leaning, to look around, because he thought someone else was shooting my target; I thought he was racist at the time, since everyone else was white, but now I realise he was probably looking at my rank), and won one of two awards another time, even though everyone else had more experience than me. My dad taught me when I was probably about 6, or 7; in India.

                                            It's not like vaccination prevents the spread of Covid; it still just goes into your body, and you spread it around ‚àµ sharing is caring; otherwise there's more than enough vaccination for herd immunity to kick in, and to stop the spread of Covid dead in it's tracks. This seems more like an attempt to placebo the population into not wearing masks, and other bad habits; like buisnesses performing illegal searches, and miranda rights not including "You have the right to demands a search warrant!"; for random stops, and whatnot.

                                                                How do I get it? UniLodge needs me to get vaccinated to protect others who are vaccinated, because the vaccines don't work, meanwhile I never got Covid.

                                                                I went to the free clinic near Westies at Belco, but they said they don't have any doctors; only nurses.
                                                                A man walks into a hospital, and says "I want to talk to a doctor"; UC hospital doesn't have doctors.
                                                                I went to Macquarie Pl, and they said I could book in four days.
                                                                I went to Calvary, and they made me wait a quarter of a day for no"-thing"; their doctors aren't as qualified as GPs.

                                                                Today; I'm going all the way out to Charnwood, since I can still book a bulk-billing GP there for today, but I'm not hopeful (I'm not hopeful of Legal Aid either), and I'll be disappointed iff UniLodge throws out all my stuff (or someone else iff they give my room away), before I return. They wouldn't extend my key, and by the time I returned from Calvary; it was one in the morning, and the person blocking me wasn't the person on call for lockouts; so I snuck in, and I'm sending this in advanced, since I probably won't be able to get back into my room by the time I get back, unless I get the exemption.

                                                                I'd rather go homeless, instead of getting vaccinated; it's not like they work anyway, and now there's multiple strains.

                                                                They did this a year ago, but never check iff I was vaccinated; these were my thoughts back then (basically, I just think they Volkswagen'd it; since the government still puts meat in hospitals, schools, and prisons, they disregard the carcinogenicity of meat as proven by the world health organisation; I don't see gore labelling on meat products either) (I removed the last two paragraphs).

i received an email including "To ensure the safety of residents, staff and visitors, the University has made a decision for 2022 that all staff, residents and visitors to our student accommodation will be required to be fully vaccinated, unless they have an exemption due to medical reasons. Fully vaccinated means that 14 days have passed from the date of your second dose."

this is how i see it

12021
 29 April = 124
 12 August = 125 = lockdown
 15 October = 1,518 (and rising) = lockup
 no more lockdowns to prevent panic buying
12022
 22 January = 23,527√∑431,826 (and rising)

people (scientists) apply for funding; they don't care for consequences, as long as they get their monies worth out of their degree (i'm not just referring to animal (including homo sapiens) subject research, but robodebt,.; no artificial intelligence subject matter expert worth their /‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ|‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ|../ would automate it, but would support a human making the final decision, because artificial intelligence algorithms today don't second guess themselves, nor reason about their decisions,..)
