i received an email including "To ensure the safety of residents, staff and visitors, the University has made a decision for 2022 that all staff, residents and visitors to our student accommodation will be required to be fully vaccinated, unless they have an exemption due to medical reasons. Fully vaccinated means that 14 days have passed from the date of your second dose."

this is how i see it

12021
 29 April = 124
 12 August = 125 = lockdown
 15 October = 1,518 (and rising) = lockup
 no more lockdowns to prevent panic buying
12022
 22 January = 23,527√∑431,826 (and rising)

so the vaccines aren't doing any"-thing", or they are giving gifts that keep on giving (/instant|delayed/ release is possible, so you'd never know; instant could also mean you had it since a fortnight ago, delayed release could also mean the vaccine' name got worn out), or rng (solve overpopulation by lottery),..

you know no"-thing"
tests are inconclusive; /(double|triple|..)? (false|true)/ positives, /(double|triple|..)? (false|true)/ negatives, feedback loops,.. #dr_jon_snow
/clinical trials|human subject research/ of vaccines go a little some"-thing" like this; dubious test assumes human subject doesn't have covid, and they get vaccinated; dubious test assumes patient has covid, and attempts to contaminate the test subject; dubious retest assumes subject doesn't have covid
autopsy reports probably stop at covid; why look any further? do covid deaths result in heart failure, or did they die of heart attack,.? they aren't going to look for dietary cancer, or the animal industry will crash #plausible_deniability_v_tunnel_vision
they don't even know what they are looking for

the uk government declined foi for nda for profiteering
the op requested internal review
the uk government employed illegal delaying tactics; in accordance cÃÑ their own laws
"The Moderna (and Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccines were sequenced by researchers from discarded vials"; why not just use /new|full|fresh/ vials? #dumpster_diving
the uk government employed /questionable|querious/ delaying tactics, before providing moderna /(nanopore)?/ sequencing
the uk government couldn't provide janssen /(nanopore)?/ sequencing; they just didn't have it, and "Without having full disclosure of the API how is it possible for the MHRA to issue a temporary authorisation under Regulation 174 for this medicine?" (mandatory vaccination!)
to be continued #wdt(irl)k?

the uk government is indicative of every other government
the government is corrupt; they were still prescribing tobacco well after it was well known, and established, to be carcinogenic, the same as the animal industry bribing them to delay meat carcinogenicity (causing covid, bird flu, swine flu, salmonella, mad cow disease,.; 6¬∞‚àòseparation (boomerang ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ), and it'll be a while before they remove it from prisons, schools, hospitals,.; it'll be a while before they label products cÃÑ gore;..), the same as the tobacco industry bribing the governments' medical industry to recommend against vaping (maybe; it's a possibility, and a probablity, and a puss'bility; ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‚àò'em)
it's in the vaccine mfg best interest to spread covid to establish a circular dependency
the lockdown(s) /was|w√¶re/ probably to serve the best business interest of some phb(s)
the australian government is a fuck up; they took their ttime to put out the fires, robodebt, nbn v starlink, covid,.; i'm getting sued by the government for not voting during covid, and when i walked all the way there (i'm not getting into a vehicle of any kind; public, nor private) they turned me away because they changed their minds overnight (said the guard) and this further demonstrates the incompetence of the justice department because i check their website the morning right before i left and i didn't receive any communications by any other channels (email,telephone,sms,mms,..) meanwhile my contact details where leaked to federation party (and the ato) who spam my email addres cÃÑ propaganda, meanwhile the census came to my bedroom door (i live in a dorm; if they knocked on any other door; i doubt anyone would answer anyway; so i'm not sure if they goto everyones' bedroom door) in the midst of a pandemic and set the bar out of reach for any other government department (in a democratic nation where voting isn't all that important; the department of elections gets judged based on how much money they bring in, not votes; so i'm never going to vote until they make an actual effort to want me to vote; in their rigged elections anyway, and they probably started the fires in the first place for some /fun|bet|(ph)bribe/) (census tracking spyware is more important than democracy; they use the cen$u$ data to axiom‚àòchoice who wins the lottery, and my number elevensies is up, and i'm going to roll the coins to save flipping individually, but as long as they come from my hands)
people (scientists) apply for funding; they don't care for consequences, as long as they get their monies worth out of their degree (i'm not just referring to animal (including homo sapiens) subject research, but robodebt,.; no artificial intelligence subject matter expert worth their /‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ|‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ|../ would automate it, but would support a human making the final decision, because artificial intelligence algorithms today don't second guess themselves, nor reason about their decisions,..)
#idiocracy

i'm unvaccinated, and haven't had symptoms since the beginning; when they refused to test me anyway
there's a direct cause, and effect, correlation cÃÑ vaccination = more cases
drugs weaken the immune system
iff you can't test me for (herd) immunity, nor even covidity; why vaccinate? no test confirms rejection rates
vaccination delivery was a problem in the beginning, but the obvious solution was smoking it into the lungs #ga√±jƒÅ
"Coltsfoot has a long history of use as a cure for respiratory issues, and it contains anti-inflammatory compounds that were delivered directly to the lung tissues through smoking."

my ùÑû3 axiom‚àòchoice; "exemption due to medical reasons", relocation (probably camp out in the bush, and reboot prolog later, and save rent; rent assistance is less than rent, so i'd have more money for supplies, but i need a home address, but i can get a po box, and maybe homeless shelter can be home address, but i'll have to garbage collect 99% of my "-thing"s), vaccination
i'm going to the free clinic today for exemption; iff i can't find (alternative /('verse|'versal)?/) doctor who will exempt me, then i'll the /y?i/ ching it; by electorally flipping 1,008 (commas are parity checks against transcription err) different coins to avoid individual bias, and {0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2) = 6,048 total flips
heads = vaccination (decapitation by a /super(bug|(swarm)?intelligence)/ that sings; just keep growing, just keep growing, growing, growing, growing, what do we do? we grow, grow, grow #ga√±jƒÅ)
tails = relocation (between my legs; i'm a front tail monkey magic ‚àà planet‚àòapes)
