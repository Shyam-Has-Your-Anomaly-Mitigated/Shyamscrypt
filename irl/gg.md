among us is now @ndroid; i can finally play the game i spent so long watching others play, like the kid staring through the shop window; among n008
 i perceive other players in a different way compared to how they probably perceive me #metadvantage
now that adblocker$ are all fake; i uninstalled every"-thing" #gtfo

i just discovered google has a fishing game; for 404 results (what happens when you type in obscure mantras)

i haven't seen these yet #/l+tp/
that crazy magic game; (ride along /stream|river|../) throw it on the ground (in a puddle), burials (like that demo where you can shoot tunnels, but i never got anywhere…), sex magic (babies, plants, eggs,.; sometimes these are /new|resurrected|npc?|../ players, depending iff a new player joins the server, providing buffs, and grogu,..),..
 this one is the one with the crazy graphics; the wizard strikes the ground c̄ staff (i think there's both lightning, and cracks, but they might be the same,..),..
 it's like /fortnite on steroids (had a baby on steroids)+/; that crazy spy game is just pure steroids (like the sting 1973, focus 2015,..)
 it got better when they added /jizz|dream|../ wizards
 crack the magicalanguages (like those magical hacking books), and recite fromemory(/pañcamī|ablative|../),.; for the most power
that crazy chase game; it's kind of like raft c̄ /kraken|cthulhu|dinos|godzilla|../, start at land (/religions|skills|../ from items, books,.; mkships; axiomatically choose ship(s);..), good ships /are easy to disassemble|work on land|the logs trick|../, /win|race|../ conditions = /longest survival|furthest distance|most value|most (player|ship|giant|baby|..) kills|(religious|..) domination|solo|../,..

 it's also capture the flags + hunger games +.; cannibal, pirate, ethical, religious, magics,.. #alignment
 it got better when they allowed players to play giants, and they expanded it to giant v giant, giant /crafting|skills|personal dev|../, /broods?|../ can mutiny against their giant iff they don't go off to get killed (some giants eat their babies for perks, insurance,.; some giants can't control their pregnancy rate, other can,..),.. (i can't remember what happended c̄ the fleet cheat; it started c̄ roping them together, and at some point they just made a players agreement that common ships counted ftw, and they can /split|gang/, and it still counts anyway #alignment)

i think these are crazy popular, because they were early, but also because they're crazy good, and crazy deep,..
don't you just l-word not knowing what another player is saying, and then they start attacking your storage, and then you swap that valuable item for another valuable item, and then you start thinking they can't access it iff another player is, and then they drop an even more valuable item in, and then you learn how trading works, and then you might be able to finally understand their /gibberish|pixell?ated voice|../,.. #magicircle

the no spoiler movements, learning the game together, /funn?ess/, cheating (the games can see /screen sniping|observer paradox|logs|../; some games kill the player, others debuff,.; some do no"-thing" (apparently)),..
that crazy game; it's like prop hunt, but you can be ghosts, or the ghosts can move items (capture the flags? visible + slowness; blueprints,..), blind the enemy (become visible v (de)buff; slow, speed, weak, keaw,..), i can't remember the other characters (i think they all become ghosts; i remember jotting some of this down on paper ages ago), base has mfg (erutpac the flags? /faster|correct|../ quizzing improves /quality|../ of /weapons|ammo|../),..

to be a decider, it's all software

 the official meta is us v them, where they have to stop any cracker from taking any of the money, without getting caught; everyone who participates will somehow be arrested, and die doing ttime, and the money will stay to build up until the best cracker dies, but the best crackers go for no kill streaks #irobot #sci-fi_author #..(i'm so stoned)

microwave pulses manipulate the spin vector; quantum gates

longer algorithms suffering from noise is actually the fucking echo of the microwave pulses
iff we new the geometry of the whatever the fuck the microwaves are bouncing around inside of, then we could calculate to compensate for the echo in our quantum programs

is there a game out where you can weaponise a giant fork,.? i just had a flash(back?)
the giant fork technique is to jump forward(s), and throw(spear (threading the needle) v chakra (cfg, hold one button to spin /faster|slower/ (a button per axis, like skateboarding; or joy dicks), and one button to throw /faster|slower (over wall)/, like throwing knives,..) v sideways log (aoe) v..) it when you see around the corner; favours grounded players, since the trajectory is physically consistent (expect for intelligent bugs), and the other player can step out of the way of the giant flying fork

  full contact was allowed until the metastrat became, all the worst players on our team will sprint into their best player, and our best player can out manoeuvre the other team, and it became like bludgeoning quidditch, but a tidal wave of red flaggers, and their target didn't even have the ball; "goto $player" is now well defined as (goto (before player)), where every"-thing"s a s/variable/shyam factor/
