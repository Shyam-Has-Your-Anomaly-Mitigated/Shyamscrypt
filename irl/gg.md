iff over 50% (target) audience suffer criminally insane tendancies then it's probably to blame; mein kampf v /killing|eating|wearing|../ animals v..
 yet another way to shutdown the animal industry iff 'tweren't for corruption; evidence suggests the shutdown demands purging to drop the rates, and keep them down for the count

among us is now @ndroid; i can finally play the game i spent so long watching others play, like the kid staring through the shop window; among n008
 i perceive other players in a different way compared to how they probably perceive me #metadvantage

i just discovered google has a fishing game; for 404 results (what happens when you type in obscure mantras)

i haven't seen these yet #/l+tp/
that crazy magic game; (ride along /stream|river|../) throw it on the ground (in a puddle), burials (like that demo where you can shoot tunnels, but i never got anywhere…), sex magic (babies, plants,..),..
 this one is the one with the crazy graphics; the wizard strikes the ground c̄ staff (i think there's both lightning, and cracks, but they might be the same,..),..
 it's like /fortnite on steroids (had a baby on steroids)+/
 it got better when they added /jizz|dream|../ wizards
 crack the magicalanguages (like those magical hacking books), and recite fromemory(/pañcamī|ablative|../),.; for the most power
that crazy chase game; it's kind of like raft c̄ /kraken|cthulhu|dinos|godzilla|../, start at land (/religions|skills|../ from items, books,.; mkships; axiomatically choose ship(s);..), good ships /are easy to disassemble|work on land|the logs trick|../, /win|race|../ conditions = /longest survival|furthest distance|most value|most (player|ship|giant|baby|..) kills|(religious|..) domination|solo|../,..
 this one is where the /speed|wind|(doggy)?paddle|../ factors the giants, and their babies are like sharks in raft; birds /drop|swoop|dive (crash v down under)|../
 it's also capture the flags + hunger games +..; cannibal, pirate, ethical, religious, magics,..
 it got better when they allowed players to play giants, and they expanded it to giant v giant, giant /crafting|skills|personal dev|../,.. (i can't remember what happended c̄ the fleet cheat; it started c̄ roping them together, and at some point they just made a players agreement that common ships counted ftw, and they can /split|gang/, and it still counts anyway)
 /drop|pord/ some"-thing", and be accused iff witness chooses same ship; like among us, dread hunger (bone knives),..
i think these are crazy popular, because they were early, but also because they're crazy good, and crazy deep,..
don't you just l-word not knowing what another player is saying, and then they start attacking your storage, and then you swap that valuable item for another valuable item, and then you start thinking they can't access it iff another player is, and then they drop an even more valuable item in, and then you learn how trading works, and then you might be able to finally understand their /gibberish|pixell?ated voice|../,.. #magicircle
does "the experience", or whatever it's called, count as a game? member when they managed to lock everyone up in the jail experience? member when people thought the poo burgers, and pee tea, wasn't real; not even c̄ video evidence? member the classroom ones, where they read a book, and everyone turns to look at you? member walking behind the reader to read over their shoulder, and they turn to look at you? member the person walking in through the wall behind the reader, and whispers some"-thing" important, /before|and then/ leaves?
the no spoiler movements, learning the game together, /funn?ess/,..
