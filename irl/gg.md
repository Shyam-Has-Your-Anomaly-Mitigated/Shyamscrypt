iff over 50% (target) audience suffer criminally insane tendancies then it's probably to blame; mein kampf v /killing|eating|wearing|../ animals v..
 yet another way to shutdown the animal industry iff 'tweren't for corruption; evidence suggests the shutdown demands purging to drop the rates, and keep them down for the count

among us is now @ndroid; i can finally play the game i spent so long watching others play, like the kid staring through the shop window; among n008
 i perceive other players in a different way compared to how they probably perceive me #metadvantage

i just discovered google has a fishing game; for 404 results (what happens when you type in obscure mantras)

i haven't seen these yet #/l+tp/
that crazy magic game; (ride along /stream|river|../) throw it on the ground (in a puddle), burials (like that demo where you can shoot tunnels, but i never got anywhere…), sex magic (babies, plants, eggs,.; sometimes these are /new|resurrected|npc?|../ players, depending iff a new player joins the server, providing buffs, and grogu,..),..
 this one is the one with the crazy graphics; the wizard strikes the ground c̄ staff (i think there's both lightning, and cracks, but they might be the same,..),..
 it's like /fortnite on steroids (had a baby on steroids)+/; that crazy spy game is just pure steroids (like the sting 1973, focus 2015,..)
 it got better when they added /jizz|dream|../ wizards
 crack the magicalanguages (like those magical hacking books), and recite fromemory(/pañcamī|ablative|../),.; for the most power
that crazy chase game; it's kind of like raft c̄ /kraken|cthulhu|dinos|godzilla|../, start at land (/religions|skills|../ from items, books,.; mkships; axiomatically choose ship(s);..), good ships /are easy to disassemble|work on land|the logs trick|../, /win|race|../ conditions = /longest survival|furthest distance|most value|most (player|ship|giant|baby|..) kills|(religious|..) domination|solo|../,..
 this one is where the /speed|wind|(doggy)?paddle|../ factors the giants, and their babies are like sharks in raft; birds /drop|swoop|dive (crash v down under)|../
 it's also capture the flags + hunger games +.; cannibal, pirate, ethical, religious, magics,.. #alignment
 it got better when they allowed players to play giants, and they expanded it to giant v giant, giant /crafting|skills|personal dev|../, /broods?|../ can mutiny against their giant iff they don't go off to get killed (some giants eat their babies for perks, insurance,.; some giants can't control their pregnancy rate, other can,..),.. (i can't remember what happended c̄ the fleet cheat; it started c̄ roping them together, and at some point they just made a players agreement that common ships counted ftw, and they can /split|gang/, and it still counts anyway #alignment)
 /drop|pord/ some"-thing", and be accused iff witness chooses same ship; like among us, dread hunger (bone knives),..
i think these are crazy popular, because they were early, but also because they're crazy good, and crazy deep,..
don't you just l-word not knowing what another player is saying, and then they start attacking your storage, and then you swap that valuable item for another valuable item, and then you start thinking they can't access it iff another player is, and then they drop an even more valuable item in, and then you learn how trading works, and then you might be able to finally understand their /gibberish|pixell?ated voice|../,.. #magicircle
does "the experience", or whatever it's called, count as a game? member when they managed to lock everyone up in the jail experience? member when people thought the poo burgers, and pee tea, wasn't real; not even c̄ video evidence? member the classroom ones, where they read a book, and everyone turns to look at you? member walking behind the reader to read over their shoulder, and they turn to look at you? member the person walking in through the wall behind the reader, and whispers some"-thing" important, /before|and then/ leaves?
the no spoiler movements, learning the game together, /funn?ess/, cheating (the games can see /screen sniping|observer paradox|logs|../; some games kill the player, others debuff,.; some do no"-thing" (apparently)),..
that crazy game; it's like prop hunt, but you can be ghosts, or the ghosts can move items (capture the flags? visible + slowness; blueprints,..), blind the enemy (become visible v (de)buff; slow, speed, weak, keaw,..), i can't remember the other characters (i think they all become ghosts; i remember jotting some of this down on paper ages ago), base has mfg (erutpac the flags? /faster|correct|../ quizzing improves /quality|../ of /weapons|ammo|../),..
the casino servers; in time (2011), ghost possession, devil deals,..
the job games; can you exploit the system? like accountants taking coins from their customers, bribery,.; can you escape from prison? yes it's just that deep, but your ttime limit is the end of the 'verse (you always host iff the longevity isn't hosted; popularity determines payout, and only deciders get paid); job = con
the battle of the spells game; /cooking|graphing|inking|scratching|rapping|pen spinning|drumstick twirling|wand flip|breaking bboy|freerunning parkour|jackie chan|cosplay|art|illusions|"magic"|mathing|hacking|cracking|../

predicting you means an environment can be produced that you will never be law abiding; not even the trivial road rules kids know about
so pvp v axiomatised difficulty (rng, within comfort zone, challenging c̄ respect to the conceptual difference between [my nth best, and my mth best],..)
golf,.; mountain goating, path optimisation (sfx,..),..
we live in a world where anyone can do whatever entertainment; news anchor,..
 your audience pays to keep you doing what you're doing; innocent humour, bullying insultation,..
 anyone, means anyone; some formats involve just displaying the big words (cfg; auto v speech-recognised-and-highlighted-teleprompter button v..), whether be to same ttime, offending, learning a new language (from any age; babies pass the equivalence of the mirror test, when they recognise their axiomatised quality of lifestyle is dependent on their axiomatised quality of lifestyle, where the intelligent ui does it's best to teach this c̄ hacking away your freewill,..),..
it's a popularity contest, but working to help the worst is the jackpot, so everyone's a winner; it's a conceptional distance "-thing"

to be a decider, it's all software
you have to implement every spec to gain access to the deployed source
you have to solve it in all the different schools of thought, and all the different optimisations
approved experiments not autobotted must be performed by all deciders, before non-deciders can do them too
 any /poisoning|venoming|immune response|../, and you'll be locked down into quarantine until you recover; you were dumb enough to lose your decidership (enough of that, and you'll lose it permanently until you do better than fully recover; your loss is (well-informed? there are some expectations of deciders to have a brain that works) human subject research), before the decision to relax tolerance within acceptable parameters

battle of the hackerz!!! :D (/dbz?/ themed commentator,..)

photons are programmable matter; quantum eraser transforms photons into particles, but there are waves, and /wave-particles|particle-waves|dualities|../
photon emitters (conways' game of life #glider) take surrounding photons, and our immune system interprets like sleightly flipped sight
the same for hearing; phonons v photons v other senses v..
topology proves donut-shaped handled mugs = doughnuts, where i am the /(vv|uu)?hole/, and the rest; programmable perception is like renderings(observer paradox proves positional information is unknowable, and there goes calculus) + sensory interpretations +..
