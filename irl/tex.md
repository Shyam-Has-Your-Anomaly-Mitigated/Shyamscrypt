 maybe play shenmue on it, before s/windows/linux/; s/maybe use the host for gimp,../what the fuck was i thinking? informally unverified must be minimised @host, but maybe buy a $1 laptop for hosted warez, and shenmue could compromise my firmware, while windows already has, and i'm going to ("crack"|read|..) it anyway, and hack my own, and crack theirs, and world domination,../ (/defcon|../ exist for the government; just like /organised crime syndicates|gangs|../, where everyone does time (and prison is rigged; iff bully guards, only pigs(the prison experiment explains how other species are treated; like rat park applies to humans) will be adversarial, and i'm trigger happy #no-hesitation); just like the tor network, and other illegal sites;..) (either that, or the corrupted government is inferior to organised crime; like the chinese firewall, judges "illegally" (discretionally #karma) sentencing rape,..) (crime is good for the economy, and provides jobs to the government sellouts,..)

  clickbait(wikipedia linked it as "Make it rain Yuan with these Shenmue 3 money-making tips"; i guess my brain just dm for grqs(s)); it's only for the game, not irl
 maybe i'll just become a gamer again, and start watching all the movies, and television shows, and probably suicide from; i just can't do it, and not just from content overload, but maybe i can just road trip (c̄ free fuel, but i still have to eat, and drink, irl, and maybe even in the game; maybe even fuel isn't free anymore; is no"-thing" sacred? yes!!! :D) around open worlds aimlessly until i've memorised them like 1729 (because that's more tolerable than actually playing the game any other way),..
sandboxed(sandfox.sh,..) vm per "-thing"; email vm, online banking vm, study vm, baremetal vm,..
host blocks all i/o networking; only forwarding to the vms
 host never updates; just reinstall, and initial update only, like the offliner i rarely use, but always plan to anyway~
 /download|update|../ c̄ /mac|ip/ address spoof,..
 host is only on the smallest usb (one day /1tb|../ will be the minimum), at least two; vm (probably) can't self-host (c̄out theoretical science of computer(s))
each vm will firewall specific web services
#dotadiw
daily updates, and checking every"-thing"; ensures i can answer any questions about my bank account (/14 bit|2 byte/ figure financiosocial status), for example (and contact the bank iff any discrepancyes)

ram drives
cpu affinity, or whatever; for each vm, maybe even more /..|replicators(?)@stargate|macro drone disxs|server farms|motherboards|chips|cores|threads|../ per vm, depending on memory(any; experiments pending; do vms have backdoors? i'll crack them iff they do; putting their binary source out there is the most stupid "-thing" they can do; just use quantum "programming"; informational hardware; entangled@brain(or whatever; handy remote to channel the pussībility like e"-t"eaao); the government can't observe c̄out tripping the observer paradox alarm g a n g n a m system t y l e, and now it's just like how 5eyes started;..), computation, and whatnot

every"-thing" is a file, and organisation is entropical

i just discovered i can lick my own /beered|mousetouch/ (clean); do humans cough up furballz?
do i only use one nostril at a time? breathing in through one nostril, and out the other? sinuses?.. now i'm breathing through the other nostril; so it flipflopz
never say never is a fallacy, not a phalluse
shut up, and talk; that's a very confusing combination of commands
maybe i should make a list of funny females, and see how they run, walk(like doyle),..
