why the fuck can't i just pay over the length of the warranty? extended warranty costs more, but could be cheaper in the continuous short term; a win-win situational context

ùÑûgrand laptop‚íÆ for portability user-fryendlie /backdoor(ed|less)/ electronic security cÃÑ cooler; i had a laptop break, when i took it to canfp, and left the cooler at home
 maybe play shenmue on it, before s/windows/linux/; s/maybe use the host for gimp,../what the fuck was i thinking? informally unverified must be minimised @host, but maybe buy a $1 laptop for hosted warez, and shenmue could compromise my firmware, while windows already has, and i'm going to ("crack"|read|..) it anyway, and hack my own, and crack theirs, and world domination,../ (/defcon|../ exist for the government; just like /organised crime syndicates|gangs|../, where everyone does time (and prison is rigged; iff bully guards, only pigs(the prison experiment explains how other species are treated; like rat park applies to humans) will be adversarial, and i'm trigger happy #no-hesitation); just like the tor network, and other illegal sites;..) (either that, or the corrupted government is inferior to organised crime; like the chinese firewall, judges "illegally" (discretionally #karma) sentencing rape,..)

 maybe i'll just become a gamer again, and start watching all the movies, and television shows, and probably suicide from; i just can't do it, and not just from content overload, but maybe i can just road trip (cÃÑ free fuel, but i still have to eat, and drink, irl, and maybe even in the game; maybe even fuel isn't free anymore; is no"-thing" sacred? yes!!! :D) around open worlds aimlessly until i've memorised them like 1729 (because that's more tolerable than actually playing the game any other way),..
