 It was developed in ancient India from the 1ˢᵗ to the 4ᵗʰ century CE[1] and was in regular use by the 7ᵗʰ century CE.[9][11] The Devanagari script, composed of 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants, is the fourth most widely adopted writing system in the world,[12] being used for over 120 languages.[13]
  this was mostly for the [9][11], but anu-skrt1002@oua says there's 49 letters; not including numerals

 why would aryansanskrits not support this theory? it's so airheaded it won't work, and they never controlled the dense jungles of india like the airheaded deserts egypt
 indian migration theory; bodhidharma, the shaolin abbotts translator, buddha,..
 china v taiwan
 any genetic evidence that westerners migrated can't prove they also called themselves aryans, nor had any"-thing" to do c̄ hinduism; besides pilgrimmaging the holy land as converts from indian migration theory, or bringing no"-thing" other than conflict; attempting forced conversion, theft,..
 why the westerners want to claim hinduism is anyones' best guess; their' claim that they're all going to hell is undisputed, and it's admirable they are recognising our superiority, and questionable why they don't join us, but i guess all that remains, however improbable, must be the truth #karmi(e)s #mayavadi(e)s #..
