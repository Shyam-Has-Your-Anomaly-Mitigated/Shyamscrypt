  "Romanization of Greek is the transliteration (letter-mapping) or transcription (sound-mapping) of text from the Greek alphabet into the Latin alphabet."
  sanskrit is phonetic; letter = sound

   * i'm graphically drawn to my audible calling; i'm audibly called to my graphical drawing
  The Sanskrit language written in some Indic scripts exaggerate angles or round shapes, but this serves only to mask the underlying similarities.
  Nagari script favours symmetry set with squared outlines and right angles.
   * i'm graphically drawn to my audible calling; i'm audibly called to my graphical drawing
  In contrast, Sanskrit written in the Bangla script emphasizes the acute angles
  while the neighbouring Odia script emphasizes rounded shapes and uses cosmetically appealing "umbrella-like curves" above the script symbols.
  In the south, where Dravidian languages predominate, scripts used for Sanskrit include the Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Grantha alphabets.

  Sinhala letters are round-shaped and are written from left to right. They are the most circular-shaped script found in the Indic scripts.

 why would aryansanskrits not support this theory? it's so weakminded it won't work, and they never controlled the dense jungles of india like the airheaded deserts egypt
 indian migration theory; buddha, bodhidharma, the shaolin abbotts translator, dewasarm, srinivasa ramanujan, prabhupada, shyam,..

 any genetic evidence that westerners migrated can't prove they also called themselves aryans, nor had any"-thing" to do c̄ hinduism; besides pilgrimmaging the holy land as converts from indian migration theory, or bringing no"-thing" other than conflict; attempting forced conversion, theft,..
 why the westerners want to claim hinduism is anyones' best guess; their' claim that they're all going to hell is undisputed, and it's admirable they are recognising our superiority, and questionable why they don't join us, but i guess all that remains, however improbable, must be the truth #karmi(e)s #mayavadi(e)s #..
 i already accept the abrahamic fact white people, along c̄ everyone else, originated from india; and the fact the followers of abraham, along c̄ atheists, wiped out their genetic intelligence; and that leaves hindus as the dominant master race of humanity; but we know there are more superior races than humanity, like we've always known about spherical planets, and that the 'verse(s) probably don't revolve around here (but maybe somewhere else, per /haps|chance|se|cent|..?/?) #snowglobe
 it's laughable they started a war over this; what is their argument? their ancestors migrated into india, and became the indians today (assimilation; resistance is futile, we are the s/iskcon/ritviks (could be me in the future)?/), but what does that have to do c̄ anyone else? all the aryans migrated to india! they don't even learn the aryan language; prehistoric prakrit, ancient prakrit, old prakrit, middle prakrit, new prakrit, texting prakrit,.; the same can probably be said of every other prakrit #idiocracy
