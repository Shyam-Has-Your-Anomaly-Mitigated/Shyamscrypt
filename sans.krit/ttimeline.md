 It was developed in ancient India from the 1ˢᵗ to the 4ᵗʰ century CE[1] and was in regular use by the 7ᵗʰ century CE.[9][11] The Devanagari script, composed of 47 primary characters including 14 vowels and 33 consonants, is the fourth most widely adopted writing system in the world,[12] being used for over 120 languages.[13]
  this was mostly for the [9][11], but anu-skrt1002@oua says there's 49 letters; not including numerals

 why would aryansanskrits not support this theory? it's so weakminded it won't work, and they never controlled the dense jungles of india like the airheaded deserts egypt
 indian migration theory; bodhidharma, the shaolin abbotts translator, buddha,..
 china v taiwan
 any genetic evidence that westerners migrated can't prove they also called themselves aryans, nor had any"-thing" to do c̄ hinduism; besides pilgrimmaging the holy land as converts from indian migration theory, or bringing no"-thing" other than conflict; attempting forced conversion, theft,..
 why the westerners want to claim hinduism is anyones' best guess; their' claim that they're all going to hell is undisputed, and it's admirable they are recognising our superiority, and questionable why they don't join us, but i guess all that remains, however improbable, must be the truth #karmi(e)s #mayavadi(e)s #..
 i already accept the abrahamic fact white people, along c̄ everyone else, originated from india; and the fact the followers of abraham, along c̄ atheists, wiped out their genetic intelligence; and that leaves hindus as the dominant master race of humanity; but we know there are more superior races than humanity, like we've always known about spherical planets, and that the 'verse(s) probably don't revolve around here (but maybe somewhere else, per /haps|chance|se|cent|..?/?) #snowglobe
 it's laughable they started a war over this; what is their argument? their ancestors migrated into india, and became the indians today (assimilation; resistance is futile, we are the s/iskcon/ritviks (could be me in the future)?/), but what does that have to do c̄ anyone else? all the aryans migrated to india! they don't even learn the aryan language; prehistoric prakrit, ancient prakrit, old prakrit, middle prakrit, new prakrit, texting prakrit,.; the same can probably be said of every other prakrit #idiocracy
 the wealth of india is just so (in)valuable; westerners will jump down a s(t)inkhole into the depths of hell for it
 abrah(a)m(ā), Abram; eitherway, the wraparound a(ce) #negation #schwa_negation

 hey lets go warship these westerners for their photographic propaganda that we superposition as evidence of their karma we're nicking; we cam't lose!!! :D
