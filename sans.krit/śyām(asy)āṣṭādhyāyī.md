teaching roman' latin is (not(for any"-thing" else)) a good idea iff students learn superiorityoindic scripts; mahabharata = ma ha bha ra ta = m a h a bh a r a t a ≠ m a h a b h a r a t a = ma ha b ha ra ta = mahabharata, where indic is so perfect that mahabharata ≠ mahabharata
 /self-(realisations|enlightenment)/ v ttime-saving demonstration; demo iff studenterrmot self-improving, where the test is iff passing students use indic exclusively, where passing is 100%
 there's a chance aspirated consonants are just ligatures, like conjunct consonants; i now consider /(fewer|simpler) (varnamala|akshara)/, until theorem /prove(n|d)/ otherwise; is proofed a word? from proof reading; i proofed it in a "solid" day! so solid it counts from sunset the day before to sunrise the day after…half empty ∋ 0.25, 0.75 ∈ half full, 0.5 = superposition
 do only westerners call them semivowels? semiconsonants seems more appropriate…for hsśṣ; i guess…
