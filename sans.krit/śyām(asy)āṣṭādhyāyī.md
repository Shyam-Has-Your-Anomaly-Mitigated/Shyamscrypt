occulture, where pop is a massive fallacy; so pop your fomdom on, and prematurely renounce your idiocracy, while we pro(in our noggins)-verbally ascend to a better yuga
 thoughts are physical manifestations of geometric sound waves; eeg inception waves @yoga v rem defragmentation waves @dreamttime #perversion_inversion
 indra casts lightning in our noggins
 are we cyclops? or is that the illusion? i see your two eyes (in the mirror), but i see them from my third eye perspective, or is that the dreaming?

teaching roman' latin is (not(for any"-thing" else)) a good idea iff students learn superiorityoindic scripts; mahabharata = ma ha bha ra ta = m a h a bh a r a t a ≠ m a h a b h a r a t a = ma ha b ha ra ta = mahabharata, where indic is so perfect that mahabharata ≠ mahabharata
 /self-(realisations|enlightenment)/ v ttime-saving demonstration; demo iff studenterrmot self-improving, where the test is iff passing students use indic exclusively, where passing is 100%
 there's a chance aspirated consonants are just ligatures, like conjunct consonants; i now consider /(fewer|simpler) (varnamala|akshara)/, until theorem /prove(n|d)/ otherwise; is proofed a word? from proof reading; i proofed it in a "solid" day! so solid it counts from sunset the day before to sunrise the day after…half empty ∋ 0.25, 0.75 ∈ half full, 0.5 = superposition
 do only westerners call them semivowels? semiconsonants seems more appropriate…for hsśṣ; i guess…
sanskrit can be read in any way; it's possible the understanding is prefix, but the poetry sands it in place #inhabitance #ecnatibahni #..
 like single numeral multiplication, where {10s,11s,12s,..} are most useful for teaching multiple numeral multiplication; √roots -> stems -> (in)declinab9ndings -> internal sanding -> external sanding, at some point(s) i can reverse the fixation…
 so hear the whole story into shor2erm3mory c̄ memorisation techniques, add sand, and s/reverse/pick it apart/ #mental_gymnastics #worf #neuroplasticity #dev #..
 (picto)graphix(mnemonic) /ligatures|conjunct consonants|sanding/ in indic scripts is more mental acrobatics, where aerobics stretches mind(u) #kungfu
