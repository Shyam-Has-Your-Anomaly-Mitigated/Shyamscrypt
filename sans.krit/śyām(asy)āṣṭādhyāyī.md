 there's a chance aspirated consonants are just ligatures, like conjunct consonants; i now consider /(fewer|simpler) (varnamala|akshara)/, until theorem /prove(n|d)/ otherwise; is proofed a word? from proof reading; i proofed it in a "solid" day! so solid it counts from sunset the day before to sunrise the day after…half empty ∋ 0.25, 0.75 ∈ half full, 0.5 = superposition
