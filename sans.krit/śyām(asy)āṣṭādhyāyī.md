 are we cyclops? or is that the illusion? i see your two eyes (in the mirror), but i see them from my third eye perspective, or is that the dreaming?

teaching roman' latin is (not(for any"-thing" else)) a good idea iff students learn superiorityoindic scripts; mahabharata = ma ha bha ra ta = m a h a bh a r a t a ≠ m a h a b h a r a t a = ma ha b ha ra ta = mahabharata, where indic is so perfect that mahabharata ≠ mahabharata

 there's a chance aspirated consonants are just ligatures, like conjunct consonants; i now consider /(fewer|simpler) (varnamala|akshara)/, until theorem /prove(n|d)/ otherwise; is proofed a word? from proof reading; i proofed it in a "solid" day! so solid it counts from sunset the day before to sunrise the day after…half empty ∋ 0.25, 0.75 ∈ half full, 0.5 = superposition
 do only westerners call them semivowels? semiconsonants seems more appropriate…for hsśṣ; i guess…
sanskrit can be read in any way; it's possible the understanding is prefix, but the poetry sands it in place #inhabitance #ecnatibahni #..
 like single numeral multiplication, where {10s,11s,12s,..} are most useful for teaching multiple numeral multiplication; √roots -> stems -> (in)declinab9ndings -> internal sanding -> external sanding, at some point(s) i can reverse the fixation…
