thewebsiteisdown.com (lol; is that self-deprecating humour?) for planned maintenance; this is the 2ⁿᵈ ttime my memory serves me well-enough alone
we learned turing-complete sanskrit is all that remains after the /entropic|noisy/ waveform of the galactic s/universe/young-laplace equational multiverse/ collapses; like a homoiconic metalist∘instructions https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/TeXXiE/blob/master/LaTeX/personal_documentation/shyam.tex#L135

 when krishna s/krishna/his friend/; he probably formally hacked his friend (/yogi mind powers|(re)?writing (spacettime|reality|..)/ v reading /spacettime|reality|../ v..), as the (multintergalactic) 'verse is hacked to reboot the yuga cycles
 my initial thought was of eru ilúvatar (from avatāra, as bod(/ill?/)y harm from (bodhi)dharma; no doubt 𝄞 it's my life 𝄞 what ever i wanna do #dusty_ground) https://www.cgpgrey.com/lord-of-the-rings-mythology
  maybe we can sue them, or pirate their ip (hobbitses, tree people,..); at least they can't sue us

  mnemonics
   07 = /dwarve(s|n)/; shorter than elves
   09 = giants; biggest s/hindu numeral/digit|w?hole (hindu (number|symbol∘continuity))?/ #smatters
   11 = /elve(n|s)/; up a notch
   /66\.?6/ = /yoda|grogu/; maybe super saiyan power levels are good mnemonics?

 security evaluation returns an impressive list of vulnerabilities resulting in no"-thing" being done about the overexpensive implementations that would provide a feedback loop of vulnerabilities requiring security analysis; formal methods is only a single feature; homoiconic meta wins
 b movers are a significant factor for observational measurements; fast for ≥72h, until no b movers, and that is the true value

  experiments could just strip away c̄out 100% extraction
  probabilistic (bio)programming; (/(ass?)?/well) it works some of the ttime
 firefox crashed again; i should do this in emacth, but they have `(rng \t)`, but unix cp cats can probably tell emacth it's not a fucking tabby cat, but emacth has a lithp so it doesn't understand any other language
 offerings are water (pot), fire (ghee lamp), air (fan), earth (flowers, prasāda, cloth,..), æther (mantras, thoughtful prayers,..),.
the official way to learn sanskrit is memorising the 4k hd grammarules∘pāṇini for examination a year later, followed by memorising the dictionary; this can be done in half a decade, but prolog is the shortcut (don't /floss|quine/; it's better not to prolog; /government|buisness|crackers|../' backdoors,.; this is the reason the signs have /lea?d/ me ashtray so i'ven't started prolog yet; when they gave me the book test, i'm told, i reached for the money, but fell backwards onto the book; krishna pulled me back; this reflects the nature of my life; i got a degree, and can't get the money; if i renounce my principles, i won't adopt anyone elses, and just murder, home invasion, steal identities, terrorise /government|business|../ workers ∵ i know where they work,.; now i find my calling card; i've fulfilled occult research, and secret methods of experimental science; /unlicensed|pirating is the only way to access it/ v ttime travel)
 this is all i remember from before the crash, but offerings was post-crash; there might be more missing linings, wordings,..
pāṇini invented alphabetical ordering
importance of pronounciation; this western lecturer was educated by indians, but other westerners don't care for pronounciation, but indians don't care for scripts like (devanāgarī; the script of the city of the gods) v (brāhmī; the original script); sanskrit is scriptless (the codeless code; the sauceless sauce)

   anti cryptic is bad; for the obvious reason of /transcending|ascending|../ to a higher yuga∘existence
   anti aryan invasion theory is good; aryan invasion theorists should yuga-change for their own good (they already mutilate each others genitals so they know whose on theirside; this is like fight club, just how far they're willing to go to hell as arseholes)

sanskrit is an ideal retirement project

sanskrit is the mother of all languages; even if aryan invasion theorists deny it; s/indo/hindu|sanskrit/-european linguistics is to hindu-arabic mathematics is to hindu-muslim unification is to..
 to challenge westerners; why did all the yogis migrate to india? if 'tweren't the sacred holy land named bharata, and mahabharata includes all the -istans; who can deny rāma setu? the evidence is clear as day light
 the westerners are to blame for every"-thing", and this includes the muslims who also attempted to desecrate the archæological evidence, but for reading /spacettime|reality/ like a book; burning∘witch is like lynching∘black

 the muslims believe s/south africa|cradle of life/śrī laṅkā/; it's a shame they probably desecrated the archæological evidence to support it
 cradle of life was just for s/african slaves/indian slaves/, aryan invasion theory,..
 archæological prospecting is as good as a divining rod
