Maybe it's the old style like a (अ), and ā (आ), from the first week, and o (ओ), and au (औ), from this week? I can't even find Unicode for Egenes' devanāgarī, nor your' devanāgarī; but it looks like Omniglot uses your' devanāgarī. I checked devanāgarī, and nandināgarī, Unicodes; Unicode doesn't appear to support nāgarī (if it does; Wikipedia doesn't know about it yet), but it does support brāhmī (which is older than nāgarī, so I'm disappointed they don't support nāgarī).

That document suggests there is a modern style, but it's missing आ (ā), and ओ (o), and their ल (ḷ) has a different stroke order; so they must be ultramodern styles from the neoteric lipikara.

Are there any other books for all 10 saṃskṛta courses ANU has to offer besides these?
A Sanskrit Grammar For Students by MacDonell (9ᵗʰ edition); I assume this is the one we need.
A Vedic Grammar For Students by MacDonell (5ᵗʰ edition); I don't know if we need this one?
Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney (12ᵗʰ edition); I'll probably get the hard cover, but the design looks like it suits paper back.
A Sanskrit Reader: Text, Vocabulary And Notes by Lanman (6ᵗʰ edition); I don't know if we need this one? I found it on the OUA website.
So far, I found them all at mlbdbook.com; so that's where I'm going to order them once they figure out Egenes' Introduction To Sanskrit (revised international edition; they used to have about 10 different pages, then I sent an email about it, they didn't respond, but I checked, and they reduced it to two pages per book, then I sent an email about the first book; the paper back listed 408 pages, while the hard cover listed 386 pages; they didn't respond, but I checked now, and it looks like they merged them into one page, but it only lists the paper back price for one book; maybe it'll stay that way as a new discount, but I don't think so; they're not very communicative, at all; so I don't know if any of these changes to their website are from my emails, and their chat system didn't work before I started emailing them).
I just realised both of MacDonells' books have both paper back, and hard cover; but they are merged into a single page, with one price, and no way to select which one; like Egenes…

I'm preparing to memorise all saṃskṛta, but I'm missing this, and can't find it anywhere.

    During meditation, I noticed the pattern of nouns ending in am from Spoken Sanskrit, and I think √jal is the root, and jala is the stem, for jalam; so jalamami is aśuddham, but jalāmi is śuddham? (I am literally 3 quarters water, and majority rounds up, but it could be figuratively poetic; like in Zuì Quán.)
    The indeclinability of kutra; means kutrāsi is aśuddham, but kutra bhavasi is śuddham?
    kim is saṃskṛta, but ki is not? What is the response to makkomas kim? jayati! (So far every Vocabulary section of The Joy Of Sanskrit ends with makkomas-sūtras; I haven't looked at Week 3, yet.)
    Is everything valid in saṃskṛta, but left to interpretation, as long as you follow the rules? I've been making assumptions about saṃdhi.

1. toyaṁ bhavāmi is how I think you say "I am water.", and patraṁ jalāmi might be "I water a leaf."; Wikipedia says saṃskṛta is Subject-Object-Verb, but I haven't checked the references.
2. smarāmi ca śuddham bhavāmi ca; I am no longer sure that only, nor all, nouns end in am, like uttamam, śuddham, and aśuddham.
3. After watching the second lecture; I think ki, and jaya, might be synonymous; like toyaṁ, and patraṁ, from BG9.26.

What is our saṃskṛta saṃpradāya? In section 2 of The Joy Of Sanskrit, you mention Dr Sadananada Das. In the lectures you mention other names; including Raghavs' father?
Given most other Westerners are considered apabhraṃśa saṃpradāya, and the historical attacks by the followers of Abraham, and the pronunciation discrepancies (at least three different ṛ in kṛṣṇa, at least two different v in viṣṇu, and śiva; although Viswanatha throws a spanner into the works); I wouldn't be surprised if some saṃskṛta saṃpradāya led to Muslims taking advantage of oral tradition, since Muḥammad was over a millenia ago, or some saṃskṛta saṃpradāya led to Christians taking advantage of oral tradition, since Egenes refers to Jesuit missionaries before the 1800s; an interesting century (can't help but notice they also started publishing Western saṃskṛta books during that time, but only after their missionaries failed, otherwise saṃskṛta, as the final stand for polytheists, would've gone the way of the Egyptians who were still around the time of Jesus, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Alexander; Western apabhraṃśa pronunciation was just a drop in the bucket, but karma is our mokṣa, and their dhik!

The prophecy of rākṣasa born into brāhmaṇa families comes to mind (when I was the gopa of New Gokula; a visitor claimed to be brāhmaṇa by birth, and said he ate animals, someone said as long as no cows, but he replied with whatever tastes good); rākṣasāḥ kalim-āśritya jāyante brahma-yoniṣu (varāha purāṇa).
There's another prophecy of brāhmaṇa being hunted in the streets by rākṣasa like animals, but I haven't found it yet; the followers of Abraham are a possibility, but the future is in a superposition, so who can say for sure?

The second prophecy: "As the 10,000 year period of the Golden Age within Kali-yuga comes to a close, the lower modes of material nature will become so strong that people will lose interest in spiritual topics. Everyone will become godless. The devotees, bhaktas, and sages that are left on the planet by this time will be so unique in character, and peculiar compared with the rest of society, that they will be ridiculed and hunted down in the cities for sport like animals." (http://www.stephen-knapp.com/kalki_the_next_avatar_of_God.htm).
The Human Era is about 12,000 years old; based on the oldest known temple (probably; Kurzgesagt called it "The First Temple").
It's funny how Jesus was born at a time when all other pagans, on all continents, were dually either destroyed, or to be destroyed; I'm so Hindu, I'm blindly intoxicated by it!!! :D
I can relate to the Jedi (memory mind tricks); saṃskṛta is the spoken force (measured in decibels; or maybe it's the dark matter that holds it all together?), and self-realisations of enlightenment our lightsayer (formal logical reasoning).
Life is too short, and all is temporary; saṃskṛta is my only satisfiable goal (Loglan, Lojban, and Prolog, are all prākṛta; who needs definite clause grammars? or maybe saṃskṛta..).

I think it's like Latin names (binomial nomenclature, or scientific name; but they're completely arbitrary); I learned about this in Science Of Gardening by UTAS; it was made up by Carl von Linné so he could attach his Latin name Linnaeus at the end of over 9000 species of plants that were already known by common names, and is the most obnoxious case of biopiracy, and job fraud, I'm aware of; like Cat in Red Dward, mama tat, and mama etat, were his catchphrases.

           ^postescapeplan is to preserve; therefore no escape is necessary until output
