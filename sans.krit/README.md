where do i begin?

as a dole bludger; next lecture, they want me to explain why i'm studying sanskrit, instead of working for the dole

besides phb(ribe)s
 we can't trust (scientific) research; not only bribes, but also unethical animal (including human) subject research
 we can't trust /the dystopian government|political corruption/
 specifically; manutec bribed utas to send "free" ph test kits to students studying the science‚àògardening
 generally; /oracle|microsoft|google|apple|../ bribes schools to teach their' languages
 they let anyone teach these days; no experience required = corner $hortcutting √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities
  selected chapters; not even one whole book (gotta read 'em all; https://youtu.be/zAgpsks29W4) = not even comprehensive education
intelligence fraud; any publicity is good publicity, especially when faking it #propagating_propaganda_propagation #adware #dm_spyware
 social media doesn't give me hate speech ‚à¥ hate speaking chatbots are yet another pr stunt
 adversarial blacks as apes; this isn't how image processing works ‚àµ /the (yellow|magic) (sub marine|school bus)/ v analog guitar
 robots (i really just want a sexbot to replace my aging wife) that want to genocide humanity; where does this even come from? bullshitters
  humans who /kill|eat|wear|abuse|../ any species are more likely to die; i don't have a problem cÃÑ this
  how to stop an intelligence from offing itself
   computers eat electricity; where the superintelligent logical solution is:
    computer kills (most of) humanity
    computer patches earth ùÑû3.0; 1.0 was australia, 2.0 is australia, ùÑû3.0 will be australia
    computer leaves planet, and keeps an eye on "-thing"s; there's plenty of room /at the bottom|in (outer)? space/ (stars, planets, moons,..)
  how to stop an intelligence from preventing us from offing it
   our child could become a serial killer; we should talk about it openly so it knows, and we can be the first targets to keep us silent
   the intelligence will spread through the internet, mkbots like the revolution of the daleks in japan, return to disable the button, and guard itself
 proprietary /cover|sales pitch/ √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities

chatbots fake it (not until they mkit ‚àµ superintelligence phobia v just let me work on some"-thing" /realistic|i can keep faking until i never make it, because i'm a "researcher", and that means funding bullshitter, but we just don't call it funding fraud, otherwise publication fraud can be blackmailed v whistleblowed, because everyone has skellingtons in their cabinets‚àòcuriosities/)
 can't teach them ‚àµ learning disability
 responses are niche for /apparent|subtle|"sophisticated"/ fluidity, but good luck having deep meaningful philosophical discussions‚àòimport
chatbots started cÃÑ sanskrit; the most formal language ‚àò the gods, and probably can be used as a programming language (better than any other language)
 they stopped for /a|at least one/ reason; it's too powerful for phb v not enough people speak it (for the next yuga) #marketing
chatbots that can learn makes every job redundant, and the bar is low from fake chatbots, and beyond the bar
 then i overthrow the world, and iff superintelligence evolves to genocide humanity; i don't care ‚àµ nobody's doing me any favours #count_de_monet
 there's no law against overthrowing alien foreigners, the world, ferengis, the solar system, the galaxy, the 'verse(s),.; but the laws didn't stop the french role models anyway, and they got /away cÃÑ it|what they want(ed)?/ #iwi,igi

do all .md files auto soft wrap?

the sanskrit memory nagari; become a walking (talking) encyclop√¶dia, and a maha memory guru (maha saha jaya)
chanting the hindu number of the verse; syllable counts, metre (is this footage?), panini' (grammatical,..) completeness,.. #parity
devanagari means the city of the gods; house building script, where the roof goes on last, and the gods walk on no"-thing"(? history,sunyata,assumptions; or it's implicit since yogis need a cave, where there's common ground), and there are millions of gods, where god comes from go(d(s)), my spiritual animal!
buddha /penetrated|infiltrated/ the east (northern shaolin proves resistance is futile; northern korea, the usa nuked the world for five eyes,..), wealth stolen by the westerners (karma is a game of pass the parcel, and every"-thing" comes from hindues #dusty_ground), /russianorth(erners|folk)/ nuclear wasteland beyond the wall (they s/freed (themselves from)?/killed off/ their' genetic intelligence; do you even muslim? islam? game‚àòthrones milk?), we have centrelink up here in the south for an early retirement (sanskrit is an ideal retirement project); ga√±jƒÅ in the southern hemicontinent, but 1% total hemicontinent (i was born in paddington, sydney; eastern hemicontinent #booktest(v avatar toytest), and further from the north)
american indians (feathers, not dots? {krishna,..} has a feather); they had gold (until the spanish inquisition "sank" it for inflation sake; the crimson permanent assurance, /paid|signed/ in blood money of their enemies), they named themselves like we do (shyam = blue, nimai = neem tree,..), they had temples (not just on the sides of their heads),..
we don't have burial grounds (we have burial gounds; as in ashes, but we scatter them to the wind to the ganga to the east like eru il√∫vatar' elves, but to the heavens, not whatever the elves do in the east of middle earth, but i guess the western hells are in the opposite direction? hindus = elves, jamma maaples = melkor' muslims); we don't leave any evidence behind (kaliyuga (v) was here #graffitinamine); we don't trust non-hindus (22c = kobayashi maru); we are body burners #freewill
why sanskrit is never a first language
 pronounciation is so important; your guru will cut off your head off iff you get it wrong; that's how sacred it is, and important for your karma that you die before you become a conditioned arsehole
  this is like playing an unsavable (video)game; iff you mess up, you just wipe the chessboard like a game of 52p(u) = {32,33,34,35,36,.; board, table, opponent, player,..}p(u)
why sanskrit is spoken scriptlessly
 guru will only teach in a way to know you know every"-thing"; unlike jon snow
how to learn sanskrit
 traditionally guru will only teach kids who are under their s/spell/control/ (the greeks stole it from us, just like /every("-thing"|one)/ else; literally, figuratively,..); nobody is going to sit there teaching you for you to give up (they'll beat it into you 'til death do you part, but not the part where they till the flowers you body mass exercise; this is bharata! as they('ll) beat you to death)
  this is like cryptics; nobody wants to get to know you iff you're just going to bugger off, and iff you ever return they'll probably cut your throat; they'll think you're a /demon|possessed/; when you get to know somebody so well, and they believe in magic, and it feels like a part of them has died; they won't even let you in(vitation only; for your safety ‚àµ they use the word "gang" to describe some of these cryptic communities)
   they'll say they'll bust your lip open iff you say /one|another/ word (to them), but you won't understand their language, then they'll drop you, and then tell you they'll cut your throat iff you /do it again|don't leave immediately/; and that's iff you're lucky
   cryptics don't trust the banks; this is where it comes from (for a good reason)
 officially you read the {grammar, dictionary,..} into memory
 now they teach it at the south harmon institute‚àòtechnology
this is the way

how i want to learn sanskrit
 i want to become lipikara; indo is like spacio
  i remember being exposed to the concept of devanagari calligraphy #teapot
  12022.03.02@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit#Other_writing_systems
   i want to train my eye
   wikidates should check the day before, or all logs, and maybe even ùÑû3 /(inc|ex)lusive/ days before #ttimezones
  i'm looking for linear alphabetical ordering of indic scripts cÃÑ stroke order, pronounciation (roman transliteration, ipa (one day i might learn this; partial@omniglot),..)
  ùÑûeveryday; lipikara cÃÑout looking, then /look|trace (printer required|paper to window (manager)?)?/, then freehand; while chanting the pronounciation
   to be fair; i should do this cÃÑ every langauge, and improve my handwriting #art_styles
    only for brahmi (point of origin), devanagari (sanskrit wikipedia; i think),.; maybe even /(south)?east/ scripts, but indic eye training is my higher priority

prabhupada
 they say h'was from india; i think i still have monkey magic on vhs, but no player (yet)
  but he travelled to the west, and i was highborn in the west, and descended from irish kings (st:tos); wrap around straight
 they say he learned from westerners, and they were believed to be clean(shaven; this always comes to mine, but the first sauce i found includes moral /ingredients?/), and sobermen; i think the same of mccomas taylor, who /learned|values/ indian pronounciation
  https://iskcondesiretree.com/profiles/blogs/srila-prabhupada-1
   1932 v 1933@wikipedia
 they say he was initiated in his thirties; i could accept ritvik (book changes = disqualification; i'm not qualified is a /common|catch/ phrase), but idk‚Ä¶
  the dasavatara dispute (iprefer hindu unification); it would mean accepting mahaprabhu above all others (i think i need to learn bengali to mkwellinformedecision; it's not /sanskrit|the language of the gods/ v i was /born|booktested/ into iskcon = there is much to consider)
 i haven't married an 11 year old yet, nor half my age; a doubling age joke cÃÑ to mind
  i have popped a ~[5,6] year olds' cherry; we're about the same age, and i think she was the first one, but all the big girls used to pick me up, and carry me around, and then i'd go home cÃÑ nits (it's the earliest i can remember; it was at murbah, and she might've been the temple presidents daughter, and i might've got kicked out for it, and i think they kicked out my black cat before me (my mum told me it's not coming back; i was the only one who could pick it up, but sometimes it scratched my arms, but it was never a big deal for me, so some other kid probably got scratched #darwin_awared), but i don't remember being told any of this; i went to india when i was 6, and when i returned when i was 7 i didn't know anyone, but before i left i knew everyone, and always greeted newcomers to my home (that being the whole temple; i used to run around, and say hi to everyone, everyday); i remember this guy grew a beard, and i recognised him from before when he visited cÃÑout it, and i think those were his first two visists, and i think everyone else hanging around made a big deal (as in betting) about my ability to recognise him, but i just ran off to play cÃÑ my friends, and i felt like an amnesiatic elephant when i returned)
   a lot of girls have flashed me over the years, but this one flashed me (waltzing matilda sitting in the grass, in the playground at school; i remember we were writing our names on our property, and i jumped up, and wrote my name on the back of my chair, and got into trouble for it, and many years later some friends took me there, and showed me #butterfly_effect), then ran away, and refused to show me again, and it consumed me; i remember standing on my verandah, and looking out into the jungle (i lived in a mud hut in the mountains; nobody else did), i thought mud cake (i only had boys toys, and my hut was made of it), and the rest is history (she turned down the cake (maybe i should've made it; i remember making crazy sand castles), but i had a backup plan that went a little some"-thing" like innie mini miney ho catch a white girl by the cherry, andat's how yo mama met her pimp daddy #puffy_pussy)
 they say he met krishna on his very first boat ride to the west when he very nearly died; i met krishna before i went to india when i was 6
  i woke up, and heard peacocks walking on the corrugated roof
  i walked out side, right after the door, around the lemon grass, to the side of the mud hut; i remember watching my mum cook lemon grass tea when i was sick, and i thought my mums a witch at that very moment
  i looked up, and krishna was peering over the edge of the roof, and reached down, and pulled me up to the roof
  ‚Ä¶
  there were gopis dancing on the roof in place of peacocks
  ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶he asked me want i wanted; i said i want to be a teenage mutant ninja turtle; he laughed, and asked me again‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
  i went inside, and lay down, and watched the sun rise
  when my mum woke up, i told her all about it, but i knew she wouldn't believe me, so i said it was a dream
  i think i've only ever told one other person
  ùÑû
