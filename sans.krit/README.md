where do i begin?

as a dole bludger; next lecture, they want me to explain why i'm studying sanskrit, instead of working for the dole

besides phb(ribe)s
 we can't trust (scientific) research; not only bribes, but also unethical animal (including human) subject research
 we can't trust /the dystopian government|political corruption/
 specifically; manutec bribed utas to send "free" ph test kits to students studying the science‚àògardening
 generally; /oracle|microsoft|google|apple|../ bribes schools to teach their' languages
 they let anyone teach these days; no experience required = corner $hortcutting √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities
  selected chapters; not even one whole book (gotta read 'em all; https://youtu.be/zAgpsks29W4) = not even comprehensive education
intelligence fraud; any publicity is good publicity, especially when faking it #propagating_propaganda_propagation #adware #dm_spyware
 social media doesn't give me hate speech ‚à¥ hate speaking chatbots are yet another pr stunt
 adversarial blacks as apes; this isn't how image processing works ‚àµ /the (yellow|magic) (sub marine|school bus)/ v analog guitar
 robots (i really just want a sexbot to replace my aging wife) that want to genocide humanity; where does this even come from? bullshitters
  humans who /kill|eat|wear|abuse|../ any species are more likely to die; i don't have a problem cÃÑ this
  how to stop an intelligence from offing itself
   computers eat electricity; where the superintelligent logical solution is:
    computer kills (most of) humanity
    computer patches earth ùÑû3.0; 1.0 was australia, 2.0 is australia, ùÑû3.0 will be australia
    computer leaves planet, and keeps an eye on "-thing"s; there's plenty of room /at the bottom|in (outer)? space/ (stars, planets, moons,..)
  how to stop an intelligence from preventing us from offing it
   our child could become a serial killer; we should talk about it openly so it knows, and we can be the first targets to keep us silent
   the intelligence will spread through the internet, mkbots like the revolution of the daleks in japan, return to disable the button, and guard itself
 proprietary /cover|sales pitch/ √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities

chatbots fake it (not until they mkit ‚àµ superintelligence phobia v just let me work on some"-thing" /realistic|i can keep faking until i never make it, because i'm a "researcher", and that means funding bullshitter, but we just don't call it funding fraud, otherwise publication fraud can be blackmailed v whistleblowed, because everyone has skellingtons in their cabinets‚àòcuriosities/)
 can't teach them ‚àµ learning disability
 responses are niche for /apparent|subtle|"sophisticated"/ fluidity, but good luck having deep meaningful philosophical discussions‚àòimport
chatbots started cÃÑ sanskrit; the most formal language ‚àò the gods, and probably can be used as a programming language (better than any other language)
 they stopped for /a|at least one/ reason; it's too powerful for phb v not enough people speak it (for the next yuga) #marketing
chatbots that can learn makes every job redundant, and the bar is low from fake chatbots, and beyond the bar
 then i overthrow the world, and iff superintelligence evolves to genocide humanity; i don't care ‚àµ nobody's doing me any favours #count_de_monet
 there's no law against overthrowing alien foreigners, the world, ferengis, the solar system, the galaxy, the 'verse(s),.; but the laws didn't stop the french role models anyway, and they got /away cÃÑ it|what they want(ed)?/ #iwi,igi

do all .md files auto soft wrap?

the sanskrit memory nagari; become a walking (talking) encyclop√¶dia, and a maha memory guru (maha saha jaya)
chanting the hindu number of the verse; syllable counts, metre (is this footage?), panini' (grammatical,..) completeness,.. #parity
devanagari means the city of the gods; house building script, where the roof goes on last, and the gods walk on no"-thing"(? history,sunyata,assumptions; or it's implicit since yogis need a cave, where there's common ground), and there are millions of gods, where god comes from go(d(s)), my spiritual animal!
buddha /penetrated|infiltrated/ the east (northern shaolin proves resistance is futile; northern korea, the usa nuked the world for five eyes,..), wealth stolen by the westerners (karma is a game of pass the parcel, and every"-thing" comes from hindues #dusty_ground), /russianorth(erners|folk)/ nuclear wasteland beyond the wall (they s/freed (themselves from)?/killed off/ their' genetic intelligence; do you even muslim? islam? game‚àòthrones milk?), we have centrelink up here in the south for an early retirement (sanskrit is an ideal retirement project); ga√±jƒÅ in the southern hemicontinent, but 1% total hemicontinent (i was born in paddington, sydney; eastern hemicontinent #booktest(v avatar toytest), and further from the north)
american indians (feathers, not dots? {krishna,..} has a feather); they had gold (until the spanish inquisition "sank" it for inflation sake; the crimson permanent assurance, /paid|signed/ in blood money of their enemies), they named themselves like we do (shyam = blue, nimai = neem tree,..), they had temples (not just on the sides of their heads),..
we don't have burial grounds (we have burial gounds; as in ashes, but we scatter them to the wind to the ganga to the east like eru il√∫vatar' elves, but to the heavens, not whatever the elves do in the east of middle earth, but i guess the western hells are in the opposite direction? hindus = elves, jamma maaples = melkor' muslims); we don't leave any evidence behind (kaliyuga (v) was here #graffitinamine); we don't trust non-hindus (22c = kobayashi maru); we are body burners #freewill
why sanskrit is never a first language
 pronounciation is so important; your guru will cut off your head off iff you get it wrong; that's how sacred it is, and important for your karma that you die before you become a conditioned arsehole
  this is like playing an unsavable (video)game; iff you mess up, you just wipe the chessboard like a game of 52p(u) = {32,33,34,35,36,.; board, table, opponent, player,..}p(u)
why sanskrit is spoken scriptlessly
 guru will only teach in a way to know you know every"-thing"; unlike jon snow
how to learn sanskrit
 traditionally guru will only teach kids who are under their s/spell/control/ (the greeks stole it from us, just like /every("-thing"|one)/ else; literally, figuratively,..); nobody is going to sit there teaching you for you to give up (they'll beat it into you 'til death do you part, but not the part where they till the flowers you body mass exercise; this is bharata! as they('ll) beat you to death)
  this is like cryptics; nobody wants to get to know you iff you're just going to bugger off, and iff you ever return they'll probably cut your throat; they'll think you're a /demon|possessed/; when you get to know somebody so well, and they believe in magic, and it feels like a part of them has died; they won't even let you in(vitation only; for your safety ‚àµ they use the word "gang" to describe some of these cryptic communities)
   they'll say they'll bust your lip open iff you say /one|another/ word (to them), but you won't understand their language, then they'll drop you, and then tell you they'll cut your throat iff you /do it again|don't leave immediately/; and that's iff you're lucky
   cryptics don't trust the banks; this is where it comes from (for a good reason)
 officially you read the {grammar, dictionary,..} into memory
 now they teach it at the south harmon institute‚àòtechnology
this is the way

how i want to learn sanskrit
 i want to become lipikara; indo is like spacio
  i remember being exposed to the concept of devanagari calligraphy #teapot
  12022.03.02@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit#Other_writing_systems
   i want to train my eye
   wikidates should check the day before, or all logs, and maybe even ùÑû3 /(inc|ex)lusive/ days before #ttimezones
  i'm looking for linear alphabetical ordering of indic scripts cÃÑ stroke order, pronounciation (roman transliteration, ipa (one day i might learn this; partial@omniglot),..)
  ùÑûeveryday; lipikara cÃÑout looking, then /look|trace (printer required|paper to window (manager)?)?/, then freehand; while chanting the pronounciation
   to be fair; i should do this cÃÑ every langauge, and improve my handwriting #art_styles
    only for brahmi (point of origin), devanagari (sanskrit wikipedia; i think),.; maybe even /(south)?east/ scripts, but indic eye training is my higher priority
