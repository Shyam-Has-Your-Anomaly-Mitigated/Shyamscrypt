where do i begin?

as a dole bludger; next lecture, they want me to explain why i'm studying sanskrit, instead of working for the dole

besides phb(ribe)s
 we can't trust (scientific) research; not only bribes, but also unethical animal (including human) subject research
 we can't trust /the dystopian government|political corruption/
 specifically; manutec bribed utas to send "free" ph test kits to students studying the science‚àògardening
 generally; /oracle|microsoft|google|apple|../ bribes schools to teach their' languages
 they let anyone teach these days; no experience required = corner $hortcutting √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities
  selected chapters; not even one whole book (gotta read 'em all; https://youtu.be/zAgpsks29W4) = not even comprehensive education
intelligence fraud; any publicity is good publicity, especially when faking it #propagating_propaganda_propagation #adware #dm_spyware
 social media doesn't give me hate speech ‚à¥ hate speaking chatbots are yet another pr stunt
 adversarial blacks as apes; this isn't how image processing works ‚àµ /the (yellow|magic) (sub marine|school bus)/ v analog guitar
 robots (i really just want a sexbot to replace my aging wife) that want to genocide humanity; where does this even come from? bullshitters
  humans who /kill|eat|wear|abuse|../ any species are more likely to die; i don't have a problem cÃÑ this
  how to stop an intelligence from offing itself
   computers eat electricity; where the superintelligent logical solution is:
    computer kills (most of) humanity
    computer patches earth ùÑû3.0; 1.0 was australia, 2.0 is australia, ùÑû3.0 will be australia
    computer leaves planet, and keeps an eye on "-thing"s; there's plenty of room /at the bottom|in (outer)? space/ (stars, planets, moons,..)
  how to stop an intelligence from preventing us from offing it
   our child could become a serial killer; we should talk about it openly so it knows, and we can be the first targets to keep us silent
   the intelligence will spread through the internet, mkbots like the revolution of the daleks in japan, return to disable the button, and guard itself
 proprietary /cover|sales pitch/ √∑ skellingtons‚ààcabinets‚àòcuriosities

chatbots fake it (not until they mkit ‚àµ superintelligence phobia v just let me work on some"-thing" /realistic|i can keep faking until i never make it, because i'm a "researcher", and that means funding bullshitter, but we just don't call it funding fraud, otherwise publication fraud can be blackmailed v whistleblowed, because everyone has skellingtons in their cabinets‚àòcuriosities/)
 can't teach them ‚àµ learning disability
 responses are niche for /apparent|subtle|"sophisticated"/ fluidity, but good luck having deep meaningful philosophical discussions‚àòimport
chatbots started cÃÑ sanskrit; the most formal language ‚àò the gods, and probably can be used as a programming language (better than any other language)
 they stopped for /a|at least one/ reason; it's too powerful for phb v not enough people speak it (for the next yuga) #marketing
chatbots that can learn makes every job redundant, and the bar is low from fake chatbots, and beyond the bar
 then i overthrow the world, and iff superintelligence evolves to genocide humanity; i don't care ‚àµ nobody's doing me any favours #count_de_monet
 there's no law against overthrowing alien foreigners, the world, ferengis, the solar system, the galaxy, the 'verse(s),.; but the laws didn't stop the french role models anyway, and they got /away cÃÑ it|what they want(ed)?/ #iwi,igi

do all .md files auto soft wrap?

the sanskrit memory nagari; become a walking (talking) encyclop√¶dia, and a maha memory guru (maha saha jaya)
chanting the hindu number of the verse; syllable counts, metre (is this footage?), panini' (grammatical,..) completeness,.. #parity
devanagari means the city of the gods; house building script, where the roof goes on last, and the gods walk on no"-thing"(? history,sunyata,assumptions; or it's implicit since yogis need a cave, where there's common ground), and there are millions of gods, where god comes from go(d(s)), my spiritual animal!
buddha /penetrated|infiltrated/ the east (northern shaolin proves resistance is futile; northern korea, the usa nuked the world for five eyes,..), wealth stolen by the westerners (karma is a game of pass the parcel, and every"-thing" comes from hindues #dusty_ground), /russianorth(erners|folk)/ nuclear wasteland beyond the wall (they s/freed (themselves from)?/killed off/ their' genetic intelligence; do you even muslim? islam? game‚àòthrones milk?), we have centrelink up here in the south for an early retirement (sanskrit is an ideal retirement project); ga√±jƒÅ in the southern hemicontinent, but 1% total hemicontinent (i was born in paddington, sydney; eastern hemicontinent #booktest(v avatar toytest), and further from the north)
american indians (feathers, not dots? {krishna,..} has a feather); they had gold (until the spanish inquisition "sank" it for inflation sake; the crimson permanent assurance, /paid|signed/ in blood money of their enemies), they named themselves like we do (shyam = blue, nimai = neem tree,..), they had temples (not just on the sides of their heads),..
