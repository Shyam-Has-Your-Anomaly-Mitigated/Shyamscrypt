favourite quotes:
p5pg5: dowson(his conclusion is 'that the peculiarities of the indian alphabet demonstrate its independece of all foreign origin' and that 'it may be confidently urged that all probabilities and inferences are in favour of an independent invention.')
references:
p1pg1: missing footnote for (prof. buhler was of opinion that the alphabet imported into india was made to assume native indian forms and disquised so cleverly that one would swear it was a native invetnion.^1)
[p1pg2,p2pg2]: issac taylors' the alphabet
p2pg3: 2 isaac taylor, the alphabet, vol. ii, p. 312.
p2pg4: 3 buhler, the origin of the brahma alphabet, p. 58.
@10:00; started reading, then started notes
chapter 1: no /computational dm|formal methods/, and 1800s british bias to replicate greek@egypt
p5pg1: buhler opined "that the alphabet imported into india was made to assume native indian forms" (pr3xisting); the first reference is missing
p5pg2: cunningham is looking better
p5pg3: the greeks left their pharaonic mark on egypt, but not in dia, and their great library's the source of their lies, until the pinocchios started practicing book burning into the sva of white lieschwa deletion #indusupremacy
p5pg4: i think this is the first occurance of 1800s, where indian indentured system introduced s/african slaves/indian "freerange" slaves/ c̄ sleightly forced contracts; whitney is looking worse
p5pg5: dravidian races of southern india makes me think of watery knobbly wood /elves|ents/ (stabby stabby @got); i think i'm understanding cunninghams' hieroglyphic theory, but sanskritic formalities, but hinduscript, but lipikara is ttime consuming c̄ (ash + water = ink) + bamboo
p6pg1: disses most of the anti hindu propaganda that misses the target, let alone the mark; any archaeological evidence cdr been fabricated from preserved inks, and blank manuscripts, so even carbon dating is discredited, where formal methods are superior, but for rewriting
p6pg2: the dissing continues; cunningham is in a superposition; ariana (grande in the butt era of twerking) v acarya
p6pg3: issac taylor is looking worse #probable_cause
p6pg4: they take advantage of most people not speaking this variety of langauges, but the best "-thing" buhler says is "pedantic formalism", which can't be said of literally any other part of this solar system (all the way to the nearest star; unless {vulcans,..} are real), followed by two (unconfirmed) statements
p6pg5a: the author seems to be confirming the first (unconfirmed) statement, but spoken language is a consideration for the formation of regular lines #haiku
p7: blank
p8: plate i (vide buhlers' indian brahma alphabet, plate i. and p. 58ff., and also buhlers' indian palaeography, p. 11.), missing the meaning of these symbols; probably intentionally ∵ trivial geometry
@18:52 i can't focus enough to continue this; i'm not even speed reading, nor speaking ∵ paragraphical notes, and i'm thinking about dropping out… (and i'm fast & furious right now!!! :D)
