lipikara; ink per stroke most of the ttime, but some strokes need more, or less
i have bamboo reed pens, and indian liquid ink (ash + water; sundried chinese stick ink molded into 卐), but i need a chinese ink stone, and pipette
i have air dry clay, and many tools
I want to learn computer fonts (using free/open source software), animation (stroke orders), traditional calligraphy, palm leaf manuscripts, birch bark manuscripts, clay tablet manuscripts, dyed textiles (prayer flags), carving (wood whittling, stone chiselling, and glass etching), and maybe even metallurgical artefacts (signatory wax seal stamps), alphabet soup, calligraphy cakes, and whatever else is out there, but only if they can be done vegan, or better (without killing plants).
; as I was typing this, I spontaneously decided that I want to make a Sanskrit temple, by hand (starting with models to perfect the design; maybe using microsurgical tools, if I can afford them).
 this is different; you can tell; it's obvious;

(i do two of these as my first line @a4)
svastika(÷)suastika (tilted)卐 ōṃ ॐ śūnya brahmagupta↓(÷). ०(÷)↑bakhshālī Ⅰ १ Ⅱ २ Ⅲ ३ Ⅳ ४ Ⅴ ५ Ⅵ ६ Ⅶ ७ Ⅷ ८ Ⅸ ९ rūpya ꠸
(where is that ō from? ^ that makes 𝄞3 counts, or /4|?more/?)
(pāṇini used 卐 in aṣṭādhyāyī; iff it loses in the war, maybe they'll consider it discredited? doesn't work for everyone; karma, dharma, shyama,..)
(mirrors: ⅠvⅨ, ⅢvⅥ, Ⅷ v rūpya)
(Ⅱ calligraffitic)
(Ⅳ i before put circle down under)
(Ⅴ calligraffitic, /(topological|geometrical|graffitical) (translations|transformations)/)
(Ⅶ i after put circle up over, 2ⁿᵈ /on over|over|?across (negated cross)?/)
(i have 2 letters per Ⅰ Ⅱ Ⅲ Ⅴ Ⅵ Ⅸ)

āīūṛṝḷṅñṭḍṇśṣṃḥ
vedic: ẖḫ
i've only encountered this in all the verse so far, no where else: ṁ
wikipedia: ō (there's another one, but I can't remember… bakhshâlî is probably a different language)
