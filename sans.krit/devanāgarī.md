lipikara; ink per stroke most of the ttime, but some strokes need more, or less
i have bamboo reed pens, and indian liquid ink (ash + water; sundried chinese stick ink molded into 卐), but i need a chinese ink stone, and pipette
i have air dry clay, and many tools
I want to learn computer fonts (using free/open source software), animation (stroke orders), traditional calligraphy, palm leaf manuscripts, birch bark manuscripts, clay tablet manuscripts, dyed textiles (prayer flags), carving (wood whittling, stone chiselling, and glass etching), and maybe even metallurgical artefacts (signatory wax seal stamps), alphabet soup, calligraphy cakes, and whatever else is out there, but only if they can be done vegan, or better (without killing plants).
; as I was typing this, I spontaneously decided that I want to make a Sanskrit temple, by hand (starting with models to perfect the design; maybe using microsurgical tools, if I can afford them).
 this is different; you can tell; it's obvious;
temple∘sanskrit will be like in kung fu yoga, and anyone even tries to touch a shoe will be off with their head rolled into the ten eternal flames as a vedic sacrifice; we'll use interrogative eeg lie detectors (better than dune, and like in blackkklansman; succeed x perl) to mksure it will never fall to any government,.. (you can only enter iff you agree to assassinate our enemies (tdd; stepwise refinement) should they succeed, and you survive)
 no technology will be allowed in (including watches(for the temporal(ly) impaired), hearing aids, pacemakers,..); there'll be wands(https://youtu.be/c_0E1XJP33E?t=216), portals(doorway frames), (/gold|metal/,..)detectors,..
 Also need a [hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum), a [shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage), and [the sound barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber). #tamperproof #observerparadox #..
 we'll have anti /drone|aircraft|satellite|../ defenses, and a nuclear self destruct; it'll be like the vatican, butt ww³ʳᵈ
 mantras will provide safe passage (vedanga proves how well you know sanskrit; off the top of your head v off with your head); graceful degradation (like from googles' long lost lesson on s/separation/segregation/∘languages v iff is(enabled,js) next yoda before cowth imbetween siddoost #षेध्युस् #षेध्यस् #षेध्यूस्) will ensure failsafe traps
 blindfold + handcuffs + solartrip; it'll fire flood you out iff you don't make it #weakmindedness
 a thousand shaolin poles; just like in the mover (i always thought thousand layer was like layers of /pastry|pasta/, like lasagne; or some"-thing"…)

(i do two of these as my first line @a4)
svastika(÷)suastika (tilted)卐 ōṃ ॐ śūnya brahmagupta↓(÷). ०(÷)↑bakhshālī Ⅰ १ Ⅱ २ Ⅲ ३ Ⅳ ४ Ⅴ ५ Ⅵ ६ Ⅶ ७ Ⅷ ८ Ⅸ ९ rūpya ꠸
(where is that ō from? ^ that makes 𝄞3 counts, or /4|?more/?)
(pāṇini used 卐 in aṣṭādhyāyī; iff it loses in the war, maybe they'll consider it discredited? doesn't work for everyone; karma, dharma, shyama,..)
(mirrors: ⅠvⅨ, ⅢvⅥ, Ⅷ v rūpya)
(Ⅱ calligraffitic)
(Ⅳ i before put circle down under)
(Ⅴ calligraffitic, /(topological|geometrical|graffitical) (translations|transformations)/)
(Ⅶ i after put circle up over, 2ⁿᵈ /on over|over|?across (negated cross)?/)
(i have 2 letters per Ⅰ Ⅱ Ⅲ Ⅴ Ⅵ Ⅸ)

ग = ᳣ + । + ꣻ
र = ग - । + Stroke
ख = र + व + Stroke
म = ग +  ᳔
य = ग + ॖ
स = र + म = र + य
न =  ᳔ + a; maybe `tr a $andhi`

āīūṛṝḷṅñṭḍṇśṣṃḥ
vedic: ẖḫ
i've only encountered this in all the verse so far, no where else: ṁ
wikipedia: ō (there's another one, but I can't remember… bakhshâlî is probably a different language)
